Task 1

Background: As part of the cybersecurity firm, you are tasked to develop a real-time monitoring system for network traffic using Java Stream API.

Problem: Implement two methods, `detectThreats` and `alertThreats`.

1. `detectThreats`: This method should take a Stream of network data packets (represented as a list of strings) and return a list of potential security threats. A potential threat is defined as any packet that contains the word "threat". The method should filter out packets that do not contain the word "threat", map the remaining packets to their length, sort them in descending order, and collect them into a list.
    
2. `alertThreats`: This method should take a list of potential threats (represented as a list of integers from the `detectThreats` method) and return a map where the key is the threat length and the value is the number of threats of that length. The method should map each threat to its length, group them by their length, and count the number of threats of each length.
    

Example:

Input: ["packet1", "threat1", "packet2", "threat2", "threat3"] Output: detectThreats: [7, 7, 7] alertThreats: {7=3}

Task 2

Background: The main topic is Custom Collectors in Stream API Operations. The drawn topic from the list is "Stream Performance".

Problem: Implement two methods, `detectThreatsFast` and `alertThreatsFast`.

1. `detectThreatsFast`: This method should do the same as `detectThreats` but it should use parallel streams to improve performance.
    
2. `alertThreatsFast`: This method should do the same as `alertThreats` but it should use parallel streams to improve performance.
    

Example:

Input: ["packet1", "threat1", "packet2", "threat2", "threat3"] Output: detectThreatsFast: [7, 7, 7] alertThreatsFast: {7=3}

Task 3

Background: The main topic is Custom Collectors in Stream API Operations. The drawn topic from the list is "Exception Handling".

Problem: Implement two methods, `detectThreatsWithExceptionHandling` and `alertThreatsWithExceptionHandling`.

1. `detectThreatsWithExceptionHandling`: This method should do the same as `detectThreats` but it should handle any exceptions that might occur during the stream operations.
    
2. `alertThreatsWithExceptionHandling`: This method should do the same as `alertThreats` but it should handle any exceptions that might occur during the stream operations.
    

Example:

Input: ["packet1", "threat1", "packet2", "threat2", "threat3"] Output: detectThreatsWithExceptionHandling: [7, 7, 7] alertThreatsWithExceptionHandling: {7=3}

Task 4

Background: The main topic is Custom Collectors in Stream API Operations. The drawn topic from the list is "Stream API with Data Structures".

Problem: Implement three methods, `detectThreatsDS`, `alertThreatsDS`, and `analyzeThreatsDS`.

1. `detectThreatsDS`: This method should do the same as `detectThreats` but it should return a Set instead of a List.
    
2. `alertThreatsDS`: This method should do the same as `alertThreats` but it should return a TreeMap instead of a HashMap.
    
3. `analyzeThreatsDS`: This method should take a map of threats from the `alertThreatsDS` method and return a PriorityQueue of threats, where the threats are ordered by their count.
    

Example:

Input: ["packet1", "threat1", "packet2", "threat2", "threat3"] Output: detectThreatsDS: [7] alertThreatsDS: {7=3} analyzeThreatsDS: [3]
