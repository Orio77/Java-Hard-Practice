Task 1

You are given a list of Patient objects. Each Patient has fields: id (Integer), name (String), age (Integer), diagnosis (String), and treatmentCost (Double).

Function 1: `filterAndSortPatients(List<Patient> patients)`

- Filter out patients who are under 18 years old and whose treatment cost is less than $5000.
- Sort the remaining patients by their treatment cost in descending order.
- Collect the result into a list.

Function 2: `groupPatientsByDiagnosis(List<Patient> patients)`

- Group the patients by their diagnosis.
- For each group, calculate the average treatment cost.
- Return a map where the key is the diagnosis and the value is the average treatment cost for that diagnosis.

Example Input:

List<Patient> patients = Arrays.asList(

    new Patient(1, "John Doe", 20, "Diabetes", 7000.0),

    new Patient(2, "Jane Doe", 17, "Asthma", 3000.0),

    new Patient(3, "Bob Smith", 25, "Diabetes", 8000.0),

    new Patient(4, "Alice Johnson", 30, "Cancer", 15000.0)

);

Example Output for `filterAndSortPatients(patients)`:

[

    new Patient(4, "Alice Johnson", 30, "Cancer", 15000.0),

    new Patient(3, "Bob Smith", 25, "Diabetes", 8000.0),

    new Patient(1, "John Doe", 20, "Diabetes", 7000.0)

]

Example Output for `groupPatientsByDiagnosis(patients)`:

{

    "Diabetes" : 7500.0,

    "Cancer" : 15000.0

}

Note: The tasks require you to use Java Stream API and Collectors. Make sure to handle any potential exceptions and consider performance implications.

Task 2

Topic: Stream Performance

You are given a list of Hospital objects. Each Hospital has fields: id (Integer), name (String), city (String), and patients (List). Each Patient has fields: id (Integer), name (String), age (Integer), diagnosis (String), and treatmentCost (Double).

Function 1: `findMostExpensiveTreatment(List<Hospital> hospitals)`

- Flatten the list of patients from all hospitals.
- Find the patient with the most expensive treatment cost.
- Return an Optional (it should be empty if the list of hospitals is empty).

Function 2: `groupPatientsByCityAndDiagnosis(List<Hospital> hospitals)`

- Group the patients by city and diagnosis.
- For each group, calculate the total treatment cost.
- Return a map where the key is a pair of city and diagnosis, and the value is the total treatment cost for that group.

Note: The tasks require you to use Java Stream API and Collectors. Make sure to handle any potential exceptions and consider performance implications. Use parallel streams where appropriate to improve performance.

Task 3

Topic: Error Handling Strategies

You are given a list of Doctor objects. Each Doctor has fields: id (Integer), name (String), specialty (String), and patients (List). Each Patient has fields: id (Integer), name (String), age (Integer), diagnosis (String), and treatmentCost (Double).

Function 1: `calculateAverageTreatmentCostPerSpecialty(List<Doctor> doctors)`

- Group the doctors by their specialty.
- For each group, calculate the average treatment cost of their patients.
- Return a map where the key is the specialty and the value is the average treatment cost for that specialty.

Function 2: `findDoctorsWithPatientOverAge(List<Doctor> doctors, int age)`

- Filter the doctors who have at least one patient over the given age.
- Sort the doctors by the number of such patients in descending order.
- Collect the result into a list.

Note: The tasks require you to use Java Stream API and Collectors. Make sure to handle any potential exceptions and consider performance implications. Use try-catch blocks where appropriate to handle exceptions.

Task 4

Topic: Stream API with Data Structures

You are given a Map<String, List> where the key is a doctor's name and the value is a list of their patients. Each Patient has fields: id (Integer), name (String), age (Integer), diagnosis (String), and treatmentCost (Double).

Function 1: `findDoctorWithMostExpensivePatient(Map<String, List<Patient>> doctors)`

- Find the doctor who has the patient with the most expensive treatment cost.
- Return an Optional with the doctor's name (it should be empty if the map is empty).

Function 2: `groupPatientsByDiagnosisAndDoctor(Map<String, List<Patient>> doctors)`

- Group the patients by their diagnosis and doctor.
- For each group, calculate the total treatment cost.
- Return a map where the key is a pair of diagnosis and doctor, and the value is the total treatment cost for that group.

Function 3: `findDoctorsWithPatientsOverAge(Map<String, List<Patient>> doctors, int age)`

- Filter the doctors who have at least one patient over the given age.
- Sort the doctors by the number of such patients in descending order.
- Collect the result into a list.
