Task 1

Problem: Implement a utility for the company to optimize the reading and writing of large inspection reports. The utility should be able to handle large files efficiently and provide a way to monitor the performance of file operations.

Function 1: `optimizedRead(String filePath)`

- This function should read a file from the given filePath using a BufferedInputStream.
- It should measure the time taken to read the file.
- It should return the content of the file as a String and the time taken to read the file in milliseconds.

Function 2: `optimizedWrite(String filePath, String content)`

- This function should write the given content to a file at the given filePath using a BufferedOutputStream.
- It should measure the time taken to write to the file.
- It should return the time taken to write to the file in milliseconds.

Example:

optimizedRead("inspection_report.txt"); // Returns: ["File content...", 1234]

optimizedWrite("inspection_report.txt", "New content..."); // Returns: 567

Task 2

Topic: File Permissions

Problem: Implement a utility for the company to manage file permissions for the inspection reports. The utility should be able to check and modify file permissions and provide a way to handle any exceptions that may occur during these operations.

Function 1: `checkPermissions(String filePath)`

- This function should check the permissions of a file at the given filePath.
- It should return a map with the keys "read", "write", and "execute", and boolean values indicating whether the current user has these permissions for the file.

Function 2: `changePermissions(String filePath, Map<String, Boolean> permissions)`

- This function should change the permissions of a file at the given filePath according to the given permissions map.
- It should handle any exceptions that may occur during this operation and return a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

Example:

checkPermissions("inspection_report.txt"); // Returns: {"read": true, "write": false, "execute": false}

changePermissions("inspection_report.txt", {"read": true, "write": true, "execute": false}); // Returns: true

Task 3

Topic: File Attributes

Problem: Implement a utility for the company to manage file attributes for the inspection reports. The utility should be able to retrieve and modify file attributes and handle any exceptions that may occur during these operations.

Function 1: `getAttributes(String filePath)`

- This function should retrieve the attributes of a file at the given filePath.
- It should return a map with the keys "size", "creationTime", and "lastModifiedTime", and values representing these attributes for the file.

Function 2: `setLastModifiedTime(String filePath, long time)`

- This function should set the last modified time of a file at the given filePath to the given time.
- It should handle any exceptions that may occur during this operation and return a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

Example:

getAttributes("inspection_report.txt"); // Returns: {"size": 123456, "creationTime": 1609459200000, "lastModifiedTime": 1612137600000}

setLastModifiedTime("inspection_report.txt", 1612224000000); // Returns: true

Task 4

Topic: File Handling with Data Structures

Problem: Implement a utility for the company to manage inspection reports using data structures. The utility should be able to store reports in a data structure, retrieve them, and perform operations on them.

Function 1: `storeReport(String filePath, Map<String, String> report)`

- This function should store a report represented as a map in a file at the given filePath.
- It should return a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

Function 2: `retrieveReport(String filePath)`

- This function should retrieve a report from a file at the given filePath.
- It should return the report as a map.

Function 3: `getReportsWithKeyword(String keyword)`

- This function should retrieve all reports that contain the given keyword.
- It should return a list of maps representing these reports.

Example:

storeReport("inspection_report.txt", {"title": "Inspection 1", "content": "This is an inspection report..."}); // Returns: true

retrieveReport("inspection_report.txt"); // Returns: {"title": "Inspection 1", "content": "This is an inspection report..."}

getReportsWithKeyword("inspection"); // Returns: [{"title": "Inspection 1", "content": "This is an inspection report..."}, ...]
