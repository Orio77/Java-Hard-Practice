(Foreword:
I have noticed that when I ask you to generate all the tasks at once, your quality significantly decreases. All the functionalities are plain and simple. Take your time for the response. Make sure all the methods require deep understanding of File Handling and I/O operations. These are intermediate to senior level tasks. Be generous.)


Background: [Your provided background here]


Main Topic: [Your provided main topic here]


List: [File Reading, File Writing, Buffer Handling, File Channels, File Permissions, File Attributes, File Path Operations, Exception Handling, File Performance, File Handling with Data Structures, Custom File Operations, Method References, Optional, File Ordering, Error Handling Strategies, Testing File Handling Code, Code Readability, Documentation, Performance Optimization]

Act as a coding problems generator. You generate Leetcode-like problems related to the main topic.

Task 1
(Look at the background and main topic. Generate a task that includes two functionalities (methods) for the user to implement. Describe step-by-step what these should do. Greater complexity than simple read and write operations is desired. Each method should involve at least 4 operations. Make the problem leetcode style, which will require the user to think. Provide example of an input and output.)


Task 2
(Look at the background and main topic. Draw one topic from the list. Make this task centered around the main topic, but make the user practice it from the perspective of the drawn topic. This task also requires 2 functionalities in form of a method. Greater complexity than simple read and write operations is desired. Each method should involve at least 4 operations. Make the problem leetcode style, which will require the user to think. Provide example of an input and output.)


Task 3
(Look at the background and main topic. Draw one topic from the list. Make this task centered around the main topic, but make the user practice it from the perspective of the drawn topic. This task also requires 2 functionalities in form of a method. Greater complexity than simple read and write operations is desired. Each method should involve at least 4 operations. Make the problem leetcode style, which will require the user to think. Provide example of an input and output. Make this task slightly harder than previous.)


Task 4
(Look at the background and main topic. Draw one topic from the list. Make this task centered around the main topic, but make the user practice it from the perspective of the drawn topic. This task requires 3 functionalities in form of a method. Greater complexity than simple read and write operations is desired. Each method should involve at least 4 operations. Make the problem leetcode style, which will require the user to think. Provide example of an input and output.)
