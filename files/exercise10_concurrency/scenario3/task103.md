Task 1

Problem: Implement a concurrent file handling system for the vehicle maintenance tracker. The system should be able to read from multiple maintenance record files concurrently and write the data into a single consolidated file.

Function 1: `readFilesConcurrently(List<String> filePaths)`

- This function should take a list of file paths as input.
- It should read each file concurrently using multithreading.
- Each file contains maintenance records in the format: `VehicleID, MaintenanceDate, MaintenanceType, MaintenanceDetails`.
- The function should return a list of maintenance records.

Function 2: `writeToConsolidatedFile(List<MaintenanceRecord> records, String filePath)`

- This function should take a list of maintenance records and a file path as input.
- It should write all the records into the file at the given path.
- The records should be written in the format: `VehicleID, MaintenanceDate, MaintenanceType, MaintenanceDetails`.
- If the file already exists, it should append the records to the existing file.

Example: Input:

- File 1: `V001, 2022-01-01, Oil Change, Changed engine oil`
- File 2: `V002, 2022-01-02, Tire Rotation, Rotated tires` Output: Consolidated File: `V001, 2022-01-01, Oil Change, Changed engine oil\nV002, 2022-01-02, Tire Rotation, Rotated tires`

Task 2

Topic: File Permissions

Problem: Implement a system that checks and modifies the file permissions for the maintenance record files.

Function 1: `checkFilePermissions(String filePath)`

- This function should take a file path as input.
- It should check the permissions of the file at the given path.
- It should return a string indicating the permissions (read, write, execute).

Function 2: `modifyFilePermissions(String filePath, String permissions)`

- This function should take a file path and a string indicating the desired permissions as input.
- It should modify the permissions of the file at the given path to the desired permissions.
- It should return a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

Example: Input: `checkFilePermissions("maintenance_records.txt")` Output: `read, write`

Task 3

Topic: File Handling with Data Structures

Problem: Implement a system that uses data structures to efficiently handle the maintenance records.

Function 1: `loadRecordsIntoDataStructure(String filePath)`

- This function should take a file path as input.
- It should read the file and load the maintenance records into an appropriate data structure (e.g., a HashMap where the key is the VehicleID and the value is a list of maintenance records).
- It should return the data structure.

Function 2: `findMaintenanceRecord(String vehicleID)`

- This function should take a VehicleID as input.
- It should search the data structure for the maintenance records of the given vehicle.
- It should return a list of maintenance records for the vehicle.

Example: Input: `loadRecordsIntoDataStructure("maintenance_records.txt")` Output: `{V001=[{date=2022-01-01, type=Oil Change, details=Changed engine oil}], V002=[{date=2022-01-02, type=Tire Rotation, details=Rotated tires}]}`

Task 4

Topic: Error Handling Strategies

Problem: Implement a system that handles errors during file operations.

Function 1: `safeReadFile(String filePath)`

- This function should take a file path as input.
- It should attempt to read the file at the given path.
- If an error occurs (e.g., file not found, IO error), it should catch the exception and log an error message.
- It should return the contents of the file, or an empty string if an error occurred.

Function 2: `safeWriteFile(String filePath, String content)`

- This function should take a file path and a string of content as input.
- It should attempt to write the content to the file at the given path.
- If an error occurs (e.g., file not found, IO error), it should catch the exception and log an error message.
- It should return a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

Function 3: `safeModifyFilePermissions(String filePath, String permissions)`

- This function should take a file path and a string indicating the desired permissions as input.
- It should attempt to modify the permissions of the file at the given path to the desired permissions.
- If an error occurs (e.g., file not found, IO error), it should catch the exception and log an error message.
- It should return a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

Example: Input: `safeReadFile("non_existent_file.txt")` Output: `Error: File not found: non_existent_file.txt`
