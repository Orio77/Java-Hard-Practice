Task 1

Problem: Implement a music streaming service's library management system. The system should be able to efficiently store and retrieve music files.

Function 1: `storeMusicFile(filePath: String, musicData: byte[])`

- This function should take a file path and a byte array representing music data as input.
- It should write the music data to a file at the given path.
- If the file already exists, it should overwrite the existing data.
- If any error occurs during the operation, it should throw an appropriate exception.

Function 2: `retrieveMusicFile(filePath: String): byte[]`

- This function should take a file path as input.
- It should read the file at the given path and return the data as a byte array.
- If the file does not exist, it should throw an appropriate exception.
- If any other error occurs during the operation, it should also throw an appropriate exception.

Example: Input: `storeMusicFile("/music/track1.mp3", musicData); retrieveMusicFile("/music/track1.mp3");` Output: `musicData`

Task 2

Topic: File Permissions

Problem: Implement a system that manages file permissions for the music streaming service's library management system.

Function 1: `setFilePermissions(filePath: String, permissions: Set<Permission>)`

- This function should take a file path and a set of permissions as input.
- It should set the permissions for the file at the given path.
- If the file does not exist, it should throw an appropriate exception.
- If any other error occurs during the operation, it should also throw an appropriate exception.

Function 2: `getFilePermissions(filePath: String): Set<Permission>`

- This function should take a file path as input.
- It should return the permissions for the file at the given path.
- If the file does not exist, it should throw an appropriate exception.
- If any other error occurs during the operation, it should also throw an appropriate exception.

Example: Input: `setFilePermissions("/music/track1.mp3", permissions); getFilePermissions("/music/track1.mp3");` Output: `permissions`

Task 3

Topic: File Attributes

Problem: Implement a system that manages file attributes for the music streaming service's library management system.

Function 1: `setFileAttributes(filePath: String, attributes: Map<Attribute, Object>)`

- This function should take a file path and a map of attributes as input.
- It should set the attributes for the file at the given path.
- If the file does not exist, it should throw an appropriate exception.
- If any other error occurs during the operation, it should also throw an appropriate exception.

Function 2: `getFileAttributes(filePath: String): Map<Attribute, Object>`

- This function should take a file path as input.
- It should return the attributes for the file at the given path.
- If the file does not exist, it should throw an appropriate exception.
- If any other error occurs during the operation, it should also throw an appropriate exception.

Example: Input: `setFileAttributes("/music/track1.mp3", attributes); getFileAttributes("/music/track1.mp3");` Output: `attributes`

Task 4

Topic: File Performance

Problem: Implement a system that measures and optimizes the performance of file operations for the music streaming service's library management system.

Function 1: `measureFileOperationTime(filePath: String, operation: FileOperation): long`

- This function should take a file path and a file operation as input.
- It should measure the time it takes to perform the operation on the file at the given path and return the time in milliseconds.
- If the file does not exist, it should throw an appropriate exception.
- If any other error occurs during the operation, it should also throw an appropriate exception.

Function 2: `optimizeFileOperation(filePath: String, operation: FileOperation)`

- This function should take a file path and a file operation as input.
- It should optimize the operation for the file at the given path.
- If the file does not exist, it should throw an appropriate exception.
- If any other error occurs during the operation, it should also throw an appropriate exception.

Function 3: `getFileOperationPerformance(filePath: String, operation: FileOperation): PerformanceMetrics`

- This function should take a file path and a file operation as input.
- It should return the performance metrics for the operation on the file at the given path.
- If the file does not exist, it should throw an appropriate exception.
- If any other error occurs during the operation, it should also throw an appropriate exception.

Example: Input: `measureFileOperationTime("/music/track1.mp3", FileOperation.READ); optimizeFileOperation("/music/track1.mp3", FileOperation.READ); getFileOperationPerformance("/music/track1.mp3", FileOperation.READ);` Output: `PerformanceMetrics`
