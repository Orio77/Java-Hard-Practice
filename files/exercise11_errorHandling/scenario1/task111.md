## Task 1

**Problem: File Error Recovery and Logging**

You are tasked with creating two methods for a film production company's digital asset management system. The first method, `recoverFile`, should attempt to recover a file if an error occurs during reading or writing. The second method, `logError`, should log any errors that occur during file handling.

**Method 1: recoverFile**

1. Accepts a file path as input.
2. Attempts to open the file.
3. If an error occurs, it should attempt to recover the file from a backup location.
4. Returns a boolean indicating whether the recovery was successful.

**Method 2: logError**

1. Accepts an Exception and a file path as input.
2. Writes the details of the exception to a log file.
3. Includes the file path and timestamp in the log entry.
4. Returns nothing.

Example Input: `recoverFile("/path/to/file")`, `logError(IOException, "/path/to/file")` Example Output: `true`, `null`

## Task 2

**Problem: File Permissions and Error Handling**

**Main Topic: Error Handling** **Drawn Topic: File Permissions**

You are tasked with creating two methods that handle file permissions and error handling. The first method, `checkPermissions`, should check if the application has the necessary permissions to perform read/write operations on a file. The second method, `handlePermissionError`, should handle any permission errors that occur during file handling.

**Method 1: checkPermissions**

1. Accepts a file path as input.
2. Checks if the application has read/write permissions for the file.
3. If it does not, it should throw a custom `PermissionException`.
4. Returns a boolean indicating whether the application has the necessary permissions.

**Method 2: handlePermissionError**

1. Accepts a `PermissionException` as input.
2. Logs the details of the exception.
3. Attempts to request the necessary permissions.
4. Returns a boolean indicating whether the permission request was successful.

Example Input: `checkPermissions("/path/to/file")`, `handlePermissionError(PermissionException)` Example Output: `false`, `true`

## Task 3

**Problem: File Performance and Error Handling**

**Main Topic: Error Handling** **Drawn Topic: File Performance**

You are tasked with creating two methods that handle file performance and error handling. The first method, `monitorPerformance`, should monitor the performance of file read/write operations. The second method, `handlePerformanceError`, should handle any performance errors that occur during file handling.

**Method 1: monitorPerformance**

1. Accepts a file path as input.
2. Monitors the time it takes to read/write to the file.
3. If the operation takes too long, it should throw a custom `PerformanceException`.
4. Returns the time it took to perform the operation.

**Method 2: handlePerformanceError**

1. Accepts a `PerformanceException` as input.
2. Logs the details of the exception.
3. Attempts to optimize the read/write operation.
4. Returns a boolean indicating whether the optimization was successful.

Example Input: `monitorPerformance("/path/to/file")`, `handlePerformanceError(PerformanceException)` Example Output: `5000ms`, `true`

## Task 4

**Problem: File Attributes, Ordering and Error Handling**

**Main Topic: Error Handling** **Drawn Topic: File Attributes, File Ordering**

You are tasked with creating three methods that handle file attributes, ordering and error handling. The first method, `getFileAttributes`, should retrieve the attributes of a file. The second method, `orderFiles`, should order a list of files based on a specific attribute. The third method, `handleAttributeError`, should handle any attribute errors that occur during file handling.

**Method 1: getFileAttributes**

1. Accepts a file path as input.
2. Retrieves the attributes of the file.
3. If an error occurs, it should throw a custom `AttributeException`.
4. Returns a map of the file's attributes.

**Method 2: orderFiles**

1. Accepts a list of file paths and an attribute key as input.
2. Orders the files based on the specified attribute.
3. If an error occurs, it should throw a custom `OrderingException`.
4. Returns a list of ordered file paths.

**Method 3: handleAttributeError**

1. Accepts an `AttributeException` or `OrderingException` as input.
2. Logs the details of the exception.
3. Attempts to recover the file or re-order the files.
4. Returns a boolean indicating whether the recovery or re-ordering was successful.

Example Input: `getFileAttributes("/path/to/file")`, `orderFiles(["/path/to/file1", "/path/to/file2"], "size")`, `handleAttributeError(AttributeException)` Example Output: `{"size": 5000, "creationTime": 1625256000000}`, `["/path/to/file2", "/path/to/file1"]`, `true`
