Task 1: File Handling with Buffer Handling and File Channels

Problem: You are given a large geological data file (e.g., "geological_data.txt"). Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `readFileWithBuffer(String filePath)`: This method should read the file using a buffer and return the data as a list of strings. Each string represents a line in the file. The method should handle any exceptions appropriately.
    
2. `writeFileWithChannel(String filePath, List<String> data)`: This method should write the given data to a file using a FileChannel. Each string in the list should be a new line in the file. The method should handle any exceptions appropriately.
    

Example:

Input:

- filePath = "geological_data.txt"
- data = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]

Output:

- readFileWithBuffer("geological_data.txt") -> ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]
- writeFileWithChannel("new_file.txt", data) -> The file "new_file.txt" is created with the lines "Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3".

Task 2: File Handling with File Permissions

Problem: You are given a file path (e.g., "geological_data.txt"). Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `checkFilePermissions(String filePath)`: This method should return a map with the file permissions (read, write, execute) and their values (true if the operation is allowed, false otherwise).
    
2. `setFilePermissions(String filePath, Map<String, Boolean> permissions)`: This method should set the file permissions according to the given map. The method should handle any exceptions appropriately.
    

Example:

Input:

- filePath = "geological_data.txt"
- permissions = {"read": true, "write": false, "execute": false}

Output:

- checkFilePermissions("geological_data.txt") -> {"read": true, "write": true, "execute": false}
- setFilePermissions("geological_data.txt", permissions) -> The permissions of the file "geological_data.txt" are updated.

Task 3: File Handling with File Attributes

Problem: You are given a file path (e.g., "geological_data.txt"). Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `getFileAttributes(String filePath)`: This method should return a map with the file's attributes (size, creation time, last access time, last modified time).
    
2. `setLastModifiedTime(String filePath, FileTime time)`: This method should set the last modified time of the file to the given time. The method should handle any exceptions appropriately.
    

Example:

Input:

- filePath = "geological_data.txt"
- time = FileTime.fromMillis(System.currentTimeMillis())

Output:

- getFileAttributes("geological_data.txt") -> {"size": 1024, "creationTime": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z", "lastAccessTime": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z", "lastModifiedTime": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z"}
- setLastModifiedTime("geological_data.txt", time) -> The last modified time of the file "geological_data.txt" is updated.

Task 4: File Handling with File Path Operations

Problem: You are given a file path (e.g., "geological_data.txt"). Your task is to implement three methods:

1. `getFilePathDetails(String filePath)`: This method should return a map with the file's details (file name, parent directory, absolute path, path after the root directory).
    
2. `renameFile(String filePath, String newName)`: This method should rename the file to the given new name. The method should handle any exceptions appropriately.
    
3. `moveFile(String sourcePath, String destinationPath)`: This method should move the file from the source path to the destination path. The method should handle any exceptions appropriately.
    

Example:

Input:

- filePath = "geological_data.txt"
- newName = "new_geological_data.txt"
- sourcePath = "geological_data.txt"
- destinationPath = "new_directory/geological_data.txt"

Output:

- getFilePathDetails("geological_data.txt") -> {"fileName": "geological_data.txt", "parentDirectory": ".", "absolutePath": "/Users/user/geological_data.txt", "pathAfterRoot": "Users/user/geological_data.txt"}
- renameFile("geological_data.txt", "new_geological_data.txt") -> The file "geological_data.txt" is renamed to "new_geological_data.txt".
- moveFile("geological_data.txt", "new_directory/geological_data.txt") -> The file "geological_data.txt" is moved to "new_directory/geological_data.txt".
