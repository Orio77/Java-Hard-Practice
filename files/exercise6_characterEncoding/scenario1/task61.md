Task 1: Character Encoding in Patient Record System

Problem: You are tasked with creating a system that reads patient data from a file, decodes it from a given character encoding, and writes it back to another file in a different encoding.

Method 1: `decodeFile(inputFilePath: String, outputFilePath: String, inputEncoding: String, outputEncoding: String)`

1. Open the file located at `inputFilePath` and read its content.
2. Decode the content using the `inputEncoding`.
3. Encode the decoded content using the `outputEncoding`.
4. Write the encoded content to a new file located at `outputFilePath`.

Method 2: `verifyEncoding(filePath: String, encoding: String) -> Boolean`

1. Open the file located at `filePath` and read its content.
2. Try to decode the content using the `encoding`.
3. If decoding is successful, return `True`, else return `False`.

Example:

Input: `decodeFile("input.txt", "output.txt", "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1")` Output: No output, but the content of `input.txt` is now written in `output.txt` in `ISO-8859-1` encoding.

Input: `verifyEncoding("output.txt", "ISO-8859-1")` Output: `True`

Task 2: Character Encoding and File Permissions

Problem: You are tasked with creating a system that reads patient data from a file, decodes it from a given character encoding, and writes it back to another file in a different encoding. The system should also handle file permissions to ensure data confidentiality.

Drawn Topic: File Permissions

Method 1: `decodeFileWithPermissions(inputFilePath: String, outputFilePath: String, inputEncoding: String, outputEncoding: String, permissions: String)`

1. Check if the current process has the necessary permissions to read the file at `inputFilePath`.
2. If permissions are sufficient, open the file and read its content.
3. Decode the content using the `inputEncoding`.
4. Encode the decoded content using the `outputEncoding`.
5. Check if the current process has the necessary permissions to write to the file at `outputFilePath`.
6. If permissions are sufficient, write the encoded content to the file.

Method 2: `changeFilePermissions(filePath: String, permissions: String)`

1. Check if the current process has the necessary permissions to change the permissions of the file at `filePath`.
2. If permissions are sufficient, change the file permissions to `permissions`.

Example:

Input: `decodeFileWithPermissions("input.txt", "output.txt", "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1", "rw-r--r--")` Output: No output, but the content of `input.txt` is now written in `output.txt` in `ISO-8859-1` encoding.

Input: `changeFilePermissions("output.txt", "rwxr-xr-x")` Output: No output, but the permissions of `output.txt` are now `rwxr-xr-x`.

Task 3: Character Encoding and File Attributes

Problem: You are tasked with creating a system that reads patient data from a file, decodes it from a given character encoding, and writes it back to another file in a different encoding. The system should also handle file attributes to ensure data confidentiality.

Drawn Topic: File Attributes

Method 1: `decodeFileWithAttributes(inputFilePath: String, outputFilePath: String, inputEncoding: String, outputEncoding: String, attributes: Map<String, Any>)`

1. Check if the file at `inputFilePath` has the necessary attributes specified in `attributes`.
2. If attributes are correct, open the file and read its content.
3. Decode the content using the `inputEncoding`.
4. Encode the decoded content using the `outputEncoding`.
5. Check if the current process can write the encoded content to the file at `outputFilePath` with the specified `attributes`.
6. If possible, write the encoded content to the file.

Method 2: `changeFileAttributes(filePath: String, attributes: Map<String, Any>)`

1. Check if the current process can change the attributes of the file at `filePath`.
2. If possible, change the file attributes to `attributes`.

Example:

Input: `decodeFileWithAttributes("input.txt", "output.txt", "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1", {"readonly": false})` Output: No output, but the content of `input.txt` is now written in `output.txt` in `ISO-8859-1` encoding.

Input: `changeFileAttributes("output.txt", {"hidden": true})` Output: No output, but the attributes of `output.txt` are now `{"hidden": true}`.

Task 4: Character Encoding, File Channels, and Buffer Handling

Problem: You are tasked with creating a system that reads patient data from a file, decodes it from a given character encoding, and writes it back to another file in a different encoding. The system should use file channels and buffers to handle large amounts of data efficiently.

Drawn Topic: File Channels and Buffer Handling

Method 1: `decodeFileWithChannels(inputFilePath: String, outputFilePath: String, inputEncoding: String, outputEncoding: String)`

1. Open a file channel for the file at `inputFilePath`.
2. Read the content of the file into a buffer.
3. Decode the content of the buffer using the `inputEncoding`.
4. Encode the decoded content using the `outputEncoding`.
5. Open a file channel for the file at `outputFilePath`.
6. Write the encoded content from the buffer to the file channel.

Method 2: `copyFileWithChannels(inputFilePath: String, outputFilePath: String)`

1. Open a file channel for the file at `inputFilePath`.
2. Read the content of the file into a buffer.
3. Open a file channel for the file at `outputFilePath`.
4. Write the content from the buffer to the file channel.

Method 3: `verifyFileContentWithChannels(filePath: String, expectedContent: String, encoding: String) -> Boolean`

1. Open a file channel for the file at `filePath`.
2. Read the content of the file into a buffer.
3. Decode the content of the buffer using the `encoding`.
4. Compare the decoded content with `expectedContent` and return the result.

Example:

Input: `decodeFileWithChannels("input.txt", "output.txt", "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1")` Output: No output, but the content of `input.txt` is now written in `output.txt` in `ISO-8859-1` encoding.

Input: `copyFileWithChannels("output.txt", "copy.txt")` Output: No output, but the content of `output.txt` is now copied to `copy.txt`.

Input: `verifyFileContentWithChannels("copy.txt", "expected content", "ISO-8859-1")` Output: `True` or `False` depending on whether the content of `copy.txt` matches `expected content`.
