Task 1

Problem: Implement a transaction record system that securely records and retrieves transaction data. The system should ensure accuracy and compliance in financial reporting.

Functionality 1: `recordTransaction(String transactionData, String filePath)`

This method should:

1. Open the file located at `filePath`.
2. Write the `transactionData` to the file, ensuring that each transaction is written on a new line.
3. Implement a checksum for each transaction to ensure data integrity. The checksum could be a simple hash of the transaction data.
4. Close the file after writing.

Example Input: `recordTransaction("123,456,789,100", "transactions.txt")`

Functionality 2: `retrieveTransaction(String transactionId, String filePath)`

This method should:

1. Open the file located at `filePath`.
2. Read through the file line by line until it finds a transaction with the given `transactionId`.
3. Verify the checksum of the found transaction to ensure data integrity.
4. Return the transaction data.

Example Input: `retrieveTransaction("123", "transactions.txt")` Example Output: `"123,456,789,100"`

Task 2

Topic: File Permissions

Problem: Modify the transaction record system to handle file permissions.

Functionality 1: `setFilePermissions(String filePath, String permissions)`

This method should:

1. Open the file located at `filePath`.
2. Change the file permissions to the value specified by `permissions`.
3. Check if the permissions were successfully changed.
4. Close the file.

Example Input: `setFilePermissions("transactions.txt", "rwxr--r--")`

Functionality 2: `checkFilePermissions(String filePath)`

This method should:

1. Open the file located at `filePath`.
2. Retrieve the current file permissions.
3. Close the file.
4. Return the file permissions.

Example Input: `checkFilePermissions("transactions.txt")` Example Output: `"rwxr--r--"`

Task 3

Topic: File Performance

Problem: Improve the performance of the transaction record system.

Functionality 1: `recordTransactionsBulk(List<String> transactions, String filePath)`

This method should:

1. Open the file located at `filePath`.
2. Write all the `transactions` to the file at once, instead of one at a time.
3. Implement a checksum for each transaction to ensure data integrity.
4. Close the file after writing.

Example Input: `recordTransactionsBulk(Arrays.asList("123,456,789,100", "234,567,890,200"), "transactions.txt")`

Functionality 2: `retrieveTransactionsBulk(String filePath)`

This method should:

1. Open the file located at `filePath`.
2. Read all the transactions from the file at once, instead of one at a time.
3. Verify the checksum of each transaction to ensure data integrity.
4. Return the list of transactions.

Example Input: `retrieveTransactionsBulk("transactions.txt")` Example Output: `["123,456,789,100", "234,567,890,200"]`

Task 4

Topic: Error Handling Strategies

Problem: Implement error handling strategies in the transaction record system.

Functionality 1: `recordTransactionSafe(String transactionData, String filePath)`

This method should:

1. Try to open the file located at `filePath`.
2. If the file cannot be opened, it should throw an exception with a meaningful message.
3. Write the `transactionData` to the file, ensuring that each transaction is written on a new line.
4. Implement a checksum for each transaction to ensure data integrity.
5. Close the file after writing, ensuring that the file is closed even if an error occurs.

Example Input: `recordTransactionSafe("123,456,789,100", "transactions.txt")`

Functionality 2: `retrieveTransactionSafe(String transactionId, String filePath)`

This method should:

1. Try to open the file located at `filePath`.
2. If the file cannot be opened, it should throw an exception with a meaningful message.
3. Read through the file line by line until it finds a transaction with the given `transactionId`.
4. Verify the checksum of the found transaction to ensure data integrity.
5. Close the file after reading, ensuring that the file is closed even if an error occurs.
6. If the transaction cannot be found, it should throw an exception with a meaningful message.

Example Input: `retrieveTransactionSafe("123", "transactions.txt")` Example Output: `"123,456,789,100"`

Functionality 3: `setFilePermissionsSafe(String filePath, String permissions)`

This method should:

1. Try to open the file located at `filePath`.
2. If the file cannot be opened, it should throw an exception with a meaningful message.
3. Change the file permissions to the value specified by `permissions`.
4. Check if the permissions were successfully changed.
5. Close the file, ensuring that the file is closed even if an error occurs.

Example Input: `setFilePermissionsSafe("transactions.txt", "rwxr--r--")`
