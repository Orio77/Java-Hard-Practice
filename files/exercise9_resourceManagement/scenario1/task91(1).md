**Task 1:**

Problem: Implement a system for the government agency to scan and categorize historical records. The system should have two functionalities:

1. `scanDocument(String filePath)`: This method should read a document from the given file path, extract the text from the document, and return the text as a string. The method should handle any IO exceptions that may occur during this process.
    
2. `categorizeDocument(String documentText)`: This method should analyze the text of the document and categorize it based on its content. The method should return a string representing the category of the document.
    

Example:

Input:

String documentText = scanDocument("path/to/document.txt");

String category = categorizeDocument(documentText);

Output:

"History"

**Task 2: File Permissions**

Problem: Implement a system for the government agency to manage file permissions for the digitized historical records. The system should have two functionalities:

1. `setPermissions(String filePath, String permissions)`: This method should set the permissions for the file at the given file path. The permissions should be a string in the format "rwx", where "r" represents read permission, "w" represents write permission, and "x" represents execute permission.
    
2. `getPermissions(String filePath)`: This method should return the current permissions for the file at the given file path.
    

Example:

Input:

setPermissions("path/to/document.txt", "rw-");

String permissions = getPermissions("path/to/document.txt");

Output:

"rw-"

**Task 3: File Attributes**

Problem: Implement a system for the government agency to manage file attributes for the digitized historical records. The system should have two functionalities:

1. `setAttribute(String filePath, String attribute, String value)`: This method should set the value of the specified attribute for the file at the given file path.
    
2. `getAttribute(String filePath, String attribute)`: This method should return the value of the specified attribute for the file at the given file path.
    

Example:

Input:

setAttribute("path/to/document.txt", "creationTime", "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z");

String creationTime = getAttribute("path/to/document.txt", "creationTime");

Output:

"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"

**Task 4: File Performance and Buffer Handling**

Problem: Implement a system for the government agency to optimize the performance of file operations for the digitized historical records. The system should have three functionalities:

1. `readFileWithBuffer(String filePath)`: This method should read the file at the given file path using a buffer to improve performance.
    
2. `writeFileWithBuffer(String filePath, String content)`: This method should write the given content to the file at the given file path using a buffer to improve performance.
    
3. `getFileSize(String filePath)`: This method should return the size of the file at the given file path.
    

Example:

Input:

writeFileWithBuffer("path/to/document.txt", "Hello, World!");

String content = readFileWithBuffer("path/to/document.txt");

long size = getFileSize("path/to/document.txt");

Output:

"Hello, World!"

1024

Note: The output for `getFileSize` is in bytes and may vary depending on the system and the content of the file.
