**Task 1**

**Title:** Implementing and Debugging a Graph Data Structure for Road Networks

**Description:** Given a list of roads, each represented as a pair of cities, and a list of new roads to be added, implement a graph data structure to represent the road network. Implement two methods:

1. `addRoad(city1: String, city2: String)`: Adds a new road to the graph. If the cities do not exist, they should be added. This method should handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to add roads at the same time.
    
2. `shortestPath(city1: String, city2: String)`: Returns the shortest path between two cities. Use Dijkstra's algorithm for this purpose. This method should also handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to find paths at the same time.
    

**Example:**

Input:

addRoad("CityA", "CityB")

addRoad("CityB", "CityC")

shortestPath("CityA", "CityC")

Output: `["CityA", "CityB", "CityC"]`

**Task 2**

**Topic:** Graph Traversal

**Title:** Debugging a Multithreaded Breadth-First Search

**Description:** Given a graph representing a road network and a starting city, implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm that finds all cities reachable from the starting city. Implement two methods:

1. `addRoad(city1: String, city2: String)`: Adds a new road to the graph. If the cities do not exist, they should be added. This method should handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to add roads at the same time.
    
2. `reachableCities(startCity: String)`: Returns a list of all cities reachable from the starting city using BFS. This method should also handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to find reachable cities at the same time.
    

**Example:**

Input:

addRoad("CityA", "CityB")

addRoad("CityB", "CityC")

reachableCities("CityA")

Output: `["CityB", "CityC"]`

**Task 3**

**Topic:** Advanced Data Structures (Trie)

**Title:** Implementing and Debugging a Trie for Autocomplete in a GPS System

**Description:** Implement a Trie data structure to store city names for an autocomplete feature in a GPS system. Implement two methods:

1. `insert(city: String)`: Inserts a city into the Trie. This method should handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to insert cities at the same time.
    
2. `autocomplete(prefix: String)`: Returns a list of all cities in the Trie that start with the given prefix. This method should also handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to autocomplete at the same time.
    

**Example:**

Input:

insert("New York")

insert("New Jersey")

autocomplete("New")

Output: `["New York", "New Jersey"]`

**Task 4**

**Topic:** Space and Time Complexity Analysis

**Title:** Analyzing and Optimizing the Performance of a Multithreaded Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Description:** Given a graph representing a road network, implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities. Implement three methods:

1. `addRoad(city1: String, city2: String, distance: Int)`: Adds a new road to the graph with a given distance. If the cities do not exist, they should be added. This method should handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to add roads at the same time.
    
2. `shortestPath(city1: String, city2: String)`: Returns the shortest path between two cities. This method should also handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to find paths at the same time.
    
3. `analyzePerformance(city1: String, city2: String)`: Analyzes the time and space complexity of the `shortestPath` method and returns a string describing its performance. This method should also handle concurrency issues when multiple threads are trying to analyze performance at the same time.
    

**Example:**

Input:

addRoad("CityA", "CityB", 5)

addRoad("CityB", "CityC", 3)

shortestPath("CityA", "CityC")

analyzePerformance("CityA", "CityC")

Output: `["CityA", "CityB", "CityC"]`, `"Time Complexity: O(E + VlogV), Space Complexity: O(V)"`
