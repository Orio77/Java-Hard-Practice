**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Inter-thread Communication**

**Problem:** You are given a cryptographic operation that takes a significant amount of time to complete. To optimize this, you decide to use multiple threads. However, you need to ensure that the threads are synchronized and can communicate with each other to avoid any data inconsistency.

**Function 1:** `synchronizedOperation()`: This method should implement a synchronized operation using `synchronized` keyword. It should take an input of a shared resource and perform a cryptographic operation on it.

**Function 2:** `interThreadCommunication()`: This method should implement inter-thread communication using `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`. It should take an input of a shared resource and perform a cryptographic operation on it.

**Example:** If you have a shared resource that needs to be encrypted, the `synchronizedOperation()` method should ensure that only one thread can access the resource at a time. The `interThreadCommunication()` method should ensure that once a thread has finished its operation, it notifies the other threads.

**Task 2: Thread Pools and Executors Framework**

**Problem:** You are given a large number of cryptographic operations that need to be performed. To manage the resources efficiently, you decide to use a thread pool and the Executors framework.

**Function 1:** `executeWithThreadPool()`: This method should create a fixed thread pool using the Executors framework and perform the cryptographic operations.

**Function 2:** `scheduleTasks()`: This method should schedule tasks using a ScheduledExecutorService. It should take an input of a list of cryptographic operations and the delay time for each operation.

**Example:** If you have 1000 cryptographic operations that need to be performed, the `executeWithThreadPool()` method should create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads and distribute the operations among the threads. The `scheduleTasks()` method should schedule the operations to be performed at fixed intervals.

**Task 3: Lock Objects and Atomic Variables**

**Problem:** You are given a critical section of code that performs a cryptographic operation. To ensure that the operation is atomic and thread-safe, you decide to use Lock objects and Atomic variables.

**Function 1:** `performAtomicOperation()`: This method should perform an atomic operation using Atomic variables. It should take an input of a shared resource and perform a cryptographic operation on it.

**Function 2:** `secureCriticalSection()`: This method should secure a critical section of code using a Lock object. It should take an input of a shared resource and perform a cryptographic operation on it.

**Example:** If you have a shared resource that needs to be encrypted, the `performAtomicOperation()` method should ensure that the operation is atomic and thread-safe. The `secureCriticalSection()` method should ensure that only one thread can access the critical section at a time.

**Task 4: Fork/Join Framework and Parallel Algorithms Implementation**

**Problem:** You are given a large data set that needs to be processed using a cryptographic operation. To optimize this, you decide to use the Fork/Join framework and implement a parallel algorithm.

**Function 1:** `processWithForkJoin()`: This method should implement the Fork/Join framework to divide the data set into smaller pieces, process them in parallel, and then combine the results.

**Function 2:** `implementParallelAlgorithm()`: This method should implement a parallel algorithm to perform the cryptographic operation on the data set.

**Function 3:** `optimizePerformance()`: This method should optimize the performance of the parallel algorithm by tuning the thread pool size and using techniques like work-stealing.

**Example:** If you have a large data set that needs to be encrypted, the `processWithForkJoin()` method should divide the data set into smaller pieces, process them in parallel, and then combine the results. The `implementParallelAlgorithm()` method should perform the cryptographic operation on the data set in parallel. The `optimizePerformance()` method should tune the thread pool size and use techniques like work-stealing to optimize the performance.
