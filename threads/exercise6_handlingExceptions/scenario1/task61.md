**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Exception Handling**

You are given a large dataset that needs to be processed concurrently using multiple threads. Implement two methods:

1. `processData(List<Data> dataList)`: This method should create and start multiple threads, each processing a portion of the data. Use synchronization to ensure that only one thread can access a data item at a time. Handle any exceptions that may occur during data processing.
    
2. `getResults()`: This method should return the results of the data processing once all threads have completed their tasks. If an exception occurred in any thread, this method should throw a `DataProcessingException`.
    

Example: If you have 10 data items and 2 threads, each thread should process 5 data items. If an exception occurs during data processing, `getResults()` should throw a `DataProcessingException`.

**Task 2: Thread Pools and Exception Handling**

Given the topic "Thread Pools" from the list, implement two methods related to a large-scale file processing system:

1. `createThreadPool(int n)`: This method should create a thread pool with `n` threads. Each thread should be responsible for processing a portion of the data. Handle any exceptions that may occur during data processing.
    
2. `shutdownThreadPool()`: This method should shut down the thread pool once all tasks have been completed. If an exception occurred in any thread, this method should throw a `ThreadPoolException`.
    

Example: If you create a thread pool with 5 threads, each thread should process a portion of the data. If an exception occurs during data processing, `shutdownThreadPool()` should throw a `ThreadPoolException`.

**Task 3: Concurrency Utilities and Exception Handling**

Given the topic "Concurrency Utilities" from the list, implement two methods related to a large-scale file processing system:

1. `processDataConcurrently(List<Data> dataList)`: This method should use concurrency utilities to process the data concurrently. Handle any exceptions that may occur during data processing.
    
2. `getConcurrentResults()`: This method should return the results of the concurrent data processing. If an exception occurred in any thread, this method should throw a `ConcurrentProcessingException`.
    

Example: If you have 10 data items and use concurrency utilities to process them, `getConcurrentResults()` should return the results. If an exception occurs during data processing, `getConcurrentResults()` should throw a `ConcurrentProcessingException`.

**Task 4: Executors Framework and Exception Handling**

Given the topic "Executors Framework" from the list, implement three methods related to a large-scale file processing system:

1. `createExecutorService(int n)`: This method should create an ExecutorService with `n` threads. Each thread should be responsible for processing a portion of the data. Handle any exceptions that may occur during data processing.
    
2. `shutdownExecutorService()`: This method should shut down the ExecutorService once all tasks have been completed. If an exception occurred in any thread, this method should throw an `ExecutorServiceException`.
    
3. `getExecutorServiceResults()`: This method should return the results of the data processing done by the ExecutorService. If an exception occurred in any thread, this method should throw an `ExecutorServiceException`.
    

Example: If you create an ExecutorService with 5 threads, each thread should process a portion of the data. If an exception occurs during data processing, `getExecutorServiceResults()` should throw an `ExecutorServiceException`.
