**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Inter-thread Communication in Genetic Algorithms**

Implement a genetic algorithm for solving optimization problems using Java threads. The algorithm should have two main functionalities:

1. `generatePopulation(int size)`: This method should generate a population of `size` candidate solutions. Each candidate solution should be generated by a separate thread. Use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the population is correctly updated by multiple threads.
    
2. `evolvePopulation()`: This method should simulate the evolution of the population. It should select pairs of candidate solutions (parents), generate offspring by crossover and mutation, and replace the least fit individuals in the population with the offspring. Each step of the evolution (selection, crossover, mutation, replacement) should be performed by a separate thread. Use inter-thread communication to coordinate the steps of the evolution.
    

Example Input: `generatePopulation(100)`, `evolvePopulation()`

Expected Output: A population of candidate solutions that has evolved for one generation.

**Task 2: Thread Pools and Deadlock Avoidance in Genetic Algorithms**

Implement a genetic algorithm for solving optimization problems using Java thread pools. The algorithm should have two main functionalities:

1. `initializeThreadPool(int size)`: This method should initialize a thread pool of `size` threads. These threads will be used to perform the operations of the genetic algorithm.
    
2. `runGeneration()`: This method should use the thread pool to run a generation of the genetic algorithm. It should divide the operations of the generation (selection, crossover, mutation, replacement) among the threads in the pool. Use deadlock avoidance techniques to ensure that the threads do not deadlock while updating the population.
    

Example Input: `initializeThreadPool(4)`, `runGeneration()`

Expected Output: A population of candidate solutions that has evolved for one generation, with no deadlocks occurring during the evolution.

**Task 3: Atomic Variables and ThreadLocal Usage in Genetic Algorithms**

Implement a genetic algorithm for solving optimization problems using Java threads. The algorithm should have two main functionalities:

1. `initializePopulation(int size)`: This method should initialize a population of `size` candidate solutions. Each candidate solution should be initialized by a separate thread. Use atomic variables to ensure that the population is correctly initialized by multiple threads.
    
2. `runGenerationThreadLocal()`: This method should run a generation of the genetic algorithm. It should use a ThreadLocal variable to store the state of the genetic algorithm for each thread. The state should include the current population and the best solution found so far.
    

Example Input: `initializePopulation(100)`, `runGenerationThreadLocal()`

Expected Output: A population of candidate solutions that has evolved for one generation, with each thread having its own copy of the genetic algorithm state.

**Task 4: Executors Framework and Fork/Join Framework in Genetic Algorithms**

Implement a genetic algorithm for solving optimization problems using the Java Executors and Fork/Join frameworks. The algorithm should have three main functionalities:

1. `initializeExecutors(int size)`: This method should initialize an ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool of `size` threads. These threads will be used to perform the operations of the genetic algorithm.
    
2. `runGenerationExecutors()`: This method should use the ExecutorService to run a generation of the genetic algorithm. It should submit tasks to the ExecutorService for each operation of the generation (selection, crossover, mutation, replacement).
    
3. `runGenerationForkJoin()`: This method should use the Fork/Join framework to run a generation of the genetic algorithm. It should create a RecursiveTask for each operation of the generation, and use the Fork/Join pool to execute these tasks.
    

Example Input: `initializeExecutors(4)`, `runGenerationExecutors()`, `runGenerationForkJoin()`

Expected Output: A population of candidate solutions that has evolved for one generation, with the operations of the generation being performed by tasks executed by an ExecutorService or a Fork/Join pool.
