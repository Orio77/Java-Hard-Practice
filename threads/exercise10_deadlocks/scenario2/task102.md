**Task 1: Deadlock Detection and Resolution**

Background: In a cloud computing environment, multiple threads may compete for resources, leading to a deadlock situation. Your task is to implement two methods: `detectDeadlock()` and `resolveDeadlock()`.

The `detectDeadlock()` method should take a list of threads as input and return a boolean indicating whether a deadlock exists. The `resolveDeadlock()` method should take a list of threads as input and return a list of threads after resolving the deadlock.

Example: Input: List of threads (Thread1, Thread2, Thread3, Thread4) where Thread1 is waiting for Thread2, Thread2 is waiting for Thread3, Thread3 is waiting for Thread4, and Thread4 is waiting for Thread1. Output: `detectDeadlock()` returns true. `resolveDeadlock()` returns a list of threads with no deadlock.

**Task 2: Deadlock Avoidance using Thread Priorities**

Background: Thread priorities can be used to avoid deadlocks. Your task is to implement two methods: `setPriorities()` and `runThreads()`.

The `setPriorities()` method should take a list of threads as input and set their priorities in a way that avoids deadlocks. The `runThreads()` method should take a list of threads as input and run them according to their priorities.

Example: Input: List of threads (Thread1, Thread2, Thread3, Thread4) with no priorities set. Output: `setPriorities()` sets priorities for the threads. `runThreads()` runs the threads according to their priorities with no deadlock.

**Task 3: Deadlock Avoidance using Lock Objects**

Background: Lock objects can be used to avoid deadlocks. Your task is to implement two methods: `acquireLocks()` and `releaseLocks()`.

The `acquireLocks()` method should take a list of threads and a list of lock objects as input and acquire the locks for the threads in a way that avoids deadlocks. The `releaseLocks()` method should take a list of threads and a list of lock objects as input and release the locks.

Example: Input: List of threads (Thread1, Thread2, Thread3, Thread4) and list of lock objects (Lock1, Lock2, Lock3, Lock4) with no locks acquired. Output: `acquireLocks()` acquires locks for the threads in a way that avoids deadlock. `releaseLocks()` releases the locks.

**Task 4: Deadlock Avoidance using Atomic Variables**

Background: Atomic variables can be used to avoid deadlocks. Your task is to implement three methods: `initializeVariables()`, `updateVariables()`, and `checkDeadlock()`.

The `initializeVariables()` method should take a list of threads as input and initialize atomic variables for them. The `updateVariables()` method should take a list of threads as input and update their atomic variables in a way that avoids deadlocks. The `checkDeadlock()` method should take a list of threads as input and return a boolean indicating whether a deadlock exists.

Example: Input: List of threads (Thread1, Thread2, Thread3, Thread4) with no atomic variables initialized. Output: `initializeVariables()` initializes atomic variables for the threads. `updateVariables()` updates the atomic variables in a way that avoids deadlock. `checkDeadlock()` returns false.
