**Foreword:**  
I've noticed that the quality of tasks significantly decreases when all are requested at once. The functionalities tend to be plain and simple. Please, take your time with the response. Ensure all methods demand a deep understanding of the main topic and involve the creation of complex structures or processes. These tasks should cater to intermediate to senior levels. Be detailed in your descriptions.

**Background:** Scalable Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Media Streaming: CDNs distribute media content to users worldwide, requiring efficient management of data across servers. Threads in Java can be used to manage parallel data transfers and optimizations, ensuring high availability and fast streaming speeds for users regardless of their location.

**Main Topic:** Thread Priority

**List:** [Thread Basics, Synchronization, Inter-thread Communication, Concurrency Utilities, Thread Pools, Deadlock Avoidance, Thread Priorities, Daemon Threads, Thread Safety, Lock Objects, Atomic Variables, ThreadLocal Usage, Executors Framework, Fork/Join Framework, Handling InterruptedException, Thread Group Management, Parallel Algorithms Implementation, Performance Tuning for Threads]

**Act as a coding problems generator.** You generate Leetcode-like problems related to the main topic.

**Task 1**  
(Look at the background and main topic. Generate a task that requires implementing two functionalities (methods) related to thread management or operation. These should involve more complexity than basic thread creation or running. Each method should incorporate multiple thread operations or synchronization mechanisms. Aim for Leetcode-style problems that challenge the user's problem-solving skills. Provide an example of an input scenario and the expected outcome.)

**Task 2**  
(Refer to the background and main topic. Select one topic from the list. Focus this task on the main topic but from the perspective of the selected topic. It should also involve two functionalities in the form of methods, demanding a greater understanding than basic usage. Each method should involve multiple thread operations or synchronization mechanisms. Design it in Leetcode style to stimulate critical thinking. Provide an example of an input scenario and the expected outcome.)

**Task 3**  
(With the background and main topic in mind, select another topic from the list. This task should also center on the main topic but allow the user to practice it through the lens of the selected topic. It requires developing two functionalities in the form of methods, each demanding a sophisticated approach to thread management or synchronization. Design these challenges in Leetcode style, encouraging deep thought. Provide an example of an input scenario and the expected outcome. Make this task more challenging than the previous ones.)

**Task 4**  
(Consider the background and main topic. Choose a topic from the list. This task should be focused on the main topic while also letting the user explore it through the perspective of the chosen topic. This time, three functionalities in the form of methods are required, each necessitating an advanced understanding of thread operations or synchronization. Aim for Leetcode-style complexity to truly test the user's skills. Provide an example of an input scenario and the expected outcome.)
