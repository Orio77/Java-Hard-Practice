**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Inter-thread Communication in Weather Data Processing**

You are given a weather simulation system that processes meteorological data from multiple sources in parallel using threads in Java. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `synchronizeDataProcessing()`: This method should ensure that the threads processing the data do not cause race conditions. Use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time.
    
2. `communicateBetweenThreads()`: This method should allow threads to communicate with each other to share the processed data. Use inter-thread communication mechanisms to achieve this.
    

Example: If you have three threads (Thread1, Thread2, Thread3) processing data from three different sources, the `synchronizeDataProcessing()` method should ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time. The `communicateBetweenThreads()` method should allow Thread1 to share its processed data with Thread2 and Thread3.

**Task 2: Thread Pools and Atomic Variables in Weather Simulation**

Selecting the topic of Thread Pools from the list, your task is to implement two methods:

1. `createThreadPool()`: This method should create a thread pool to process the meteorological data in parallel. The size of the thread pool should be adjustable based on the amount of data to be processed.
    
2. `useAtomicVariables()`: This method should use atomic variables to ensure that the weather prediction calculations are thread-safe.
    

Example: If you have a large amount of data to process, the `createThreadPool()` method should create a thread pool of an appropriate size to handle the load. The `useAtomicVariables()` method should ensure that the calculations for weather predictions are accurate and thread-safe.

**Task 3: Executors Framework and Handling InterruptedException in Weather Prediction**

Selecting the topic of Executors Framework from the list, your task is to implement two methods:

1. `useExecutorsFramework()`: This method should use the Executors Framework to manage the threads in the weather prediction system.
    
2. `handleInterruptedException()`: This method should handle any InterruptedExceptions that may occur during the execution of the threads.
    

Example: The `useExecutorsFramework()` method should manage the threads effectively, ensuring that they are executing in an optimal manner. The `handleInterruptedException()` method should handle any interruptions in a way that does not affect the accuracy of the weather predictions.

**Task 4: Fork/Join Framework, Thread Group Management, and Performance Tuning for Threads in Weather Simulation**

Selecting the topics of Fork/Join Framework and Thread Group Management from the list, your task is to implement three methods:

1. `useForkJoinFramework()`: This method should use the Fork/Join Framework to divide the weather data processing task into smaller tasks that can be executed in parallel.
    
2. `manageThreadGroups()`: This method should manage the threads in groups to improve the efficiency of the weather prediction system.
    
3. `tuneThreadPerformance()`: This method should tune the performance of the threads to ensure that the weather prediction system is running at its maximum efficiency.
    

Example: The `useForkJoinFramework()` method should divide the weather data processing task into smaller tasks that can be executed in parallel. The `manageThreadGroups()` method should group the threads in a way that improves the efficiency of the system. The `tuneThreadPerformance()` method should ensure that the system is running at its maximum efficiency.
