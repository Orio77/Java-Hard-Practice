**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Inter-thread Communication in Real-time Bidding System**

**Problem:** Implement a real-time bidding system where multiple threads representing different advertisers bid for an ad slot. Each ad slot can only be won by one advertiser. The system should ensure that no two advertisers can win the same ad slot (Thread Synchronization). Also, once an ad slot is won, all other advertisers should be notified not to bid for that slot anymore (Inter-thread Communication).

**Methods:**

1. `void placeBid(Advertiser advertiser, AdSlot adSlot)`: This method should be called by an advertiser thread to place a bid on an ad slot. If the ad slot is already won, this method should do nothing.
    
2. `Advertiser getWinner(AdSlot adSlot)`: This method should return the advertiser who won the bid for the given ad slot. If no one has won the bid yet, this method should return null.
    

**Example:**

Input: Advertisers A, B, C, D, E are bidding for AdSlot X. Advertiser A bids first, followed by B, C, D, and E.

Output: Advertiser A wins the bid for AdSlot X. All other advertisers are notified not to bid for AdSlot X anymore.

**Task 2: Thread Pools and Atomic Variables in Real-time Bidding System**

**Problem:** Implement a real-time bidding system where a fixed number of threads representing different advertisers bid for multiple ad slots. The system should keep track of the total number of ad slots won by all advertisers (Atomic Variables). The system should use a thread pool to manage advertiser threads (Thread Pools).

**Methods:**

1. `void startBidding(Advertiser advertiser, List<AdSlot> adSlots)`: This method should be called by an advertiser thread to start bidding for a list of ad slots. The method should add the advertiser thread to the thread pool.
    
2. `int getTotalAdSlotsWon()`: This method should return the total number of ad slots won by all advertisers.
    

**Example:**

Input: Advertisers A, B, C, D, E are bidding for AdSlots X, Y, Z. Advertiser A bids first for AdSlot X, followed by B for AdSlot Y, and C for AdSlot Z.

Output: Total number of ad slots won is 3.

**Task 3: Executors Framework and Handling InterruptedException in Real-time Bidding System**

**Problem:** Implement a real-time bidding system where multiple threads representing different advertisers bid for an ad slot. The system should use the Executors framework to manage advertiser threads. If a thread is interrupted while waiting to place a bid, it should handle the InterruptedException properly.

**Methods:**

1. `void placeBid(Advertiser advertiser, AdSlot adSlot)`: This method should be called by an advertiser thread to place a bid on an ad slot. If the thread is interrupted while waiting to place a bid, it should handle the InterruptedException.
    
2. `Advertiser getWinner(AdSlot adSlot)`: This method should return the advertiser who won the bid for the given ad slot. If no one has won the bid yet, this method should return null.
    

**Example:**

Input: Advertisers A, B, C, D, E are bidding for AdSlot X. Advertiser A bids first, followed by B, C, D, and E. Advertiser B is interrupted while waiting to place a bid.

Output: Advertiser A wins the bid for AdSlot X. Advertiser B handles the InterruptedException.

**Task 4: Fork/Join Framework, Thread Safety, and Lock Objects in Real-time Bidding System**

**Problem:** Implement a real-time bidding system where multiple threads representing different advertisers bid for multiple ad slots. The system should use the Fork/Join framework to divide the task of bidding for ad slots among advertiser threads. The system should ensure thread safety when updating the winner of an ad slot. The system should use Lock objects to prevent multiple threads from bidding for the same ad slot at the same time.

**Methods:**

1. `void placeBid(Advertiser advertiser, AdSlot adSlot)`: This method should be called by an advertiser thread to place a bid on an ad slot. The method should use a Lock object to prevent multiple threads from bidding for the same ad slot at the same time.
    
2. `Advertiser getWinner(AdSlot adSlot)`: This method should return the advertiser who won the bid for the given ad slot. If no one has won the bid yet, this method should return null.
    
3. `void startBidding(List<Advertiser> advertisers, List<AdSlot> adSlots)`: This method should start the bidding process by dividing the task of bidding for ad slots among advertiser threads using the Fork/Join framework.
    

**Example:**

Input: Advertisers A, B, C, D, E are bidding for AdSlots X, Y, Z. Advertiser A bids first for AdSlot X, followed by B for AdSlot Y, and C for AdSlot Z.

Output: Advertiser A wins the bid for AdSlot X, B for AdSlot Y, and C for AdSlot Z.
