**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Inter-thread Communication**

Problem: You are given a large dataset that needs to be processed in parallel. Implement two methods, `processDataInParallel()` and `communicateBetweenThreads()`. The `processDataInParallel()` method should create multiple threads and assign a portion of the dataset to each thread for processing. The `communicateBetweenThreads()` method should allow threads to communicate with each other to share results or status updates. Use synchronization mechanisms to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.

Example: If you have a dataset of 1000 elements and you create 10 threads, each thread should process 100 elements. The `communicateBetweenThreads()` method should allow threads to share their progress or results with each other.

**Task 2: Thread Pools and Concurrency Utilities**

Problem: Using the concept of Thread Pools and Concurrency Utilities, implement two methods, `createThreadPool()` and `utilizeConcurrencyUtilities()`. The `createThreadPool()` method should create a fixed-size thread pool and assign tasks to the threads in the pool. The `utilizeConcurrencyUtilities()` method should use concurrency utilities like `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, or `Semaphore` to control the execution flow between threads.

Example: If you create a thread pool of size 5, the `createThreadPool()` method should create 5 threads and assign tasks to them. The `utilizeConcurrencyUtilities()` method should use concurrency utilities to control the execution flow between threads.

**Task 3: Atomic Variables and Lock Objects**

Problem: With the help of Atomic Variables and Lock Objects, implement two methods, `useAtomicVariables()` and `manageLockObjects()`. The `useAtomicVariables()` method should use atomic variables to ensure atomicity of complex operations. The `manageLockObjects()` method should use lock objects to control access to shared resources.

Example: The `useAtomicVariables()` method should ensure that operations like incrementing a counter are atomic. The `manageLockObjects()` method should ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

**Task 4: Executors Framework, Fork/Join Framework, and Handling InterruptedException**

Problem: Implement three methods, `useExecutorsFramework()`, `applyForkJoinFramework()`, and `handleInterruptedException()`. The `useExecutorsFramework()` method should use the Executors framework to manage thread execution. The `applyForkJoinFramework()` method should use the Fork/Join framework to divide tasks into smaller tasks and then combine the results. The `handleInterruptedException()` method should handle InterruptedException properly to avoid potential issues.

Example: The `useExecutorsFramework()` method should create a single-thread executor and run a task. The `applyForkJoinFramework()` method should divide a large task into smaller tasks, process them in parallel, and then combine the results. The `handleInterruptedException()` method should handle InterruptedException properly to avoid potential issues.
