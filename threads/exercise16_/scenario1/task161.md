**Task 1: Thread Basics and Synchronization**

You are working on an Automated Trading System for Cryptocurrencies. Your task is to implement two methods: `monitorMarket()` and `executeTrade()`.

The `monitorMarket()` method should use multiple threads to concurrently monitor different cryptocurrency markets. Each thread should be responsible for a specific market.

The `executeTrade()` method should be synchronized to ensure that only one trade is executed at a time. This method should take a trade order as input and execute it.

Example:

Input: A list of cryptocurrency markets and a trade order Output: The markets are concurrently monitored and the trade order is executed in a synchronized manner.

**Task 2: Inter-thread Communication and Concurrency Utilities**

Considering the same Automated Trading System, your task is to implement two methods: `notifyTradeExecution()` and `waitForTradeExecution()`.

The `notifyTradeExecution()` method should be used to notify all threads when a trade has been executed. This method should use inter-thread communication to achieve this.

The `waitForTradeExecution()` method should be used by threads to wait for the notification of trade execution. This method should use concurrency utilities to handle the waiting process.

Example:

Input: A trade order Output: All threads are notified when the trade is executed and they wait for the notification using concurrency utilities.

**Task 3: Thread Pools and Atomic Variables**

In the context of the same system, your task is to implement two methods: `createThreadPool()` and `executeTrades()`.

The `createThreadPool()` method should create a thread pool with a specified number of threads.

The `executeTrades()` method should take a list of trade orders as input and execute them using the thread pool. This method should use atomic variables to keep track of the number of trades that have been executed.

Example:

Input: A list of trade orders Output: All trades are executed using the thread pool and the number of executed trades is correctly tracked.

**Task 4: Executors Framework, Handling InterruptedException, and Performance Tuning for Threads**

Still working on the same system, your task is to implement three methods: `createExecutorService()`, `executeTrades()`, and `tunePerformance()`.

The `createExecutorService()` method should create an executor service with a fixed number of threads.

The `executeTrades()` method should take a list of trade orders as input and execute them using the executor service. This method should handle any InterruptedException that might occur during the execution process.

The `tunePerformance()` method should tune the performance of the threads in the executor service.

Example:

Input: A list of trade orders Output: All trades are executed using the executor service, any InterruptedException is properly handled, and the performance of the threads is tuned.
