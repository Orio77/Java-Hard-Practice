**Task 1**

**Title:** Thread Management for Dynamic Traffic Routing

**Problem:** You are given a system that monitors network conditions and server load in real time. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `monitorNetworkConditions()`: This method should use threads to simulate the monitoring of network conditions. It should return a `Map<String, Integer>` where the keys are the names of the network conditions (e.g., "latency", "bandwidth") and the values are the corresponding measurements. Use synchronization to ensure that the threads do not interfere with each other.
    
2. `adjustRouting()`: This method should take the map returned by `monitorNetworkConditions()` as input and adjust the routing decisions based on the network conditions. It should return a `Map<String, String>` where the keys are the names of the routes and the values are the new routing decisions (e.g., "increase", "decrease"). Use synchronization to ensure that the threads do not interfere with each other.
    

**Example:**

Input: `monitorNetworkConditions()` returns `{"latency": 100, "bandwidth": 200}`

Output: `adjustRouting()` returns `{"route1": "increase", "route2": "decrease"}`

**Task 2**

**Topic:** Thread Pools

**Title:** Implementing Thread Pools for Dynamic Traffic Routing

**Problem:** Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `createThreadPool()`: This method should create a thread pool with a specified number of threads. It should return the thread pool.
    
2. `executeTasks()`: This method should take the thread pool returned by `createThreadPool()` and a list of tasks as input. Each task is a `Runnable` that simulates monitoring a network condition or adjusting a routing decision. The method should execute the tasks in the thread pool and return a `List<Future<?>>` representing the results of the tasks.
    

**Example:**

Input: `createThreadPool(5)`, `executeTasks(threadPool, tasks)`

Output: `List<Future<?>>`

**Task 3**

**Topic:** Atomic Variables

**Title:** Using Atomic Variables for Dynamic Traffic Routing

**Problem:** Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `monitorNetworkCondition()`: This method should use an `AtomicInteger` to simulate the monitoring of a network condition. It should return the `AtomicInteger`.
    
2. `adjustRouting()`: This method should take the `AtomicInteger` returned by `monitorNetworkCondition()` as input and adjust the routing decision based on the network condition. It should return a `String` representing the new routing decision.
    

**Example:**

Input: `monitorNetworkCondition()` returns `new AtomicInteger(100)`

Output: `adjustRouting(atomicInteger)` returns `"increase"`

**Task 4**

**Topic:** Executors Framework

**Title:** Using the Executors Framework for Dynamic Traffic Routing

**Problem:** Your task is to implement three methods:

1. `createExecutorService()`: This method should create an `ExecutorService` with a specified number of threads. It should return the `ExecutorService`.
    
2. `submitTasks()`: This method should take the `ExecutorService` returned by `createExecutorService()` and a list of tasks as input. Each task is a `Callable` that simulates monitoring a network condition or adjusting a routing decision. The method should submit the tasks to the `ExecutorService` and return a `List<Future<?>>` representing the results of the tasks.
    
3. `shutdownExecutorService()`: This method should take the `ExecutorService` returned by `createExecutorService()` as input and shut it down gracefully.
    

**Example:**

Input: `createExecutorService(5)`, `submitTasks(executorService, tasks)`, `shutdownExecutorService(executorService)`

Output: `List<Future<?>>`
