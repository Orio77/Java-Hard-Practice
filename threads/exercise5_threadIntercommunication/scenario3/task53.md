**Task 1: High-Speed Data Ingestion with Thread Management**

**Problem:** Implement two methods, `startIngestionPipeline()` and `stopIngestionPipeline()`. The `startIngestionPipeline()` method should create and start multiple threads that simulate the ingestion of data from different sources. The `stopIngestionPipeline()` method should stop all the running threads safely. Use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the threads start and stop in a controlled manner.

**Example:**

Input: `startIngestionPipeline(5)`  
Output: `5 threads started.`

Input: `stopIngestionPipeline()`  
Output: `All threads stopped.`

**Task 2: High-Speed Data Ingestion with Synchronization**

**Topic:** Synchronization

**Problem:** Implement two methods, `synchronizedIngestionStart()` and `synchronizedIngestionStop()`. The `synchronizedIngestionStart()` method should create and start multiple threads that simulate the ingestion of data from different sources. The threads should be synchronized such that only one thread can access the data source at a time. The `synchronizedIngestionStop()` method should stop all the running threads safely and in a synchronized manner.

**Example:**

Input: `synchronizedIngestionStart(3)`  
Output: `3 synchronized threads started.`

Input: `synchronizedIngestionStop()`  
Output: `All synchronized threads stopped.`

**Task 3: High-Speed Data Ingestion with Thread Pools**

**Topic:** Thread Pools

**Problem:** Implement two methods, `startIngestionWithThreadPool()` and `stopIngestionWithThreadPool()`. The `startIngestionWithThreadPool()` method should create a thread pool and start multiple threads that simulate the ingestion of data from different sources. The `stopIngestionWithThreadPool()` method should stop all the running threads safely and shut down the thread pool.

**Example:**

Input: `startIngestionWithThreadPool(4)`  
Output: `4 threads started with thread pool.`

Input: `stopIngestionWithThreadPool()`  
Output: `All threads stopped. Thread pool shutdown.`

**Task 4: High-Speed Data Ingestion with Concurrency Utilities**

**Topic:** Concurrency Utilities

**Problem:** Implement three methods, `startIngestionWithConcurrencyUtilities()`, `pauseIngestion()` and `stopIngestionWithConcurrencyUtilities()`. The `startIngestionWithConcurrencyUtilities()` method should create and start multiple threads that simulate the ingestion of data from different sources using concurrency utilities. The `pauseIngestion()` method should pause all running threads. The `stopIngestionWithConcurrencyUtilities()` method should stop all the running threads safely.

**Example:**

Input: `startIngestionWithConcurrencyUtilities(6)`  
Output: `6 threads started with concurrency utilities.`

Input: `pauseIngestion()`  
Output: `All threads paused.`

Input: `stopIngestionWithConcurrencyUtilities()`  
Output: `All threads stopped.`
