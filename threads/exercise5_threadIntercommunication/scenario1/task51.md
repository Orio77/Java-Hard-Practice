**Task 1: Thread Synchronization in Multiplayer Game Server**

In a multiplayer game server, managing concurrent game state updates is crucial. Implement two methods:

1. `synchronizedUpdateGameState(GameState gameState, PlayerAction playerAction)`: This method should take in the current game state and a player action, and update the game state in a thread-safe manner using `synchronized` blocks.
    
2. `synchronizedBroadcastGameState(GameState gameState, List<Player> players)`: This method should take in the current game state and a list of players, and broadcast the game state to all players in a thread-safe manner using `synchronized` blocks.
    

Example: If two players perform actions at the same time, the `synchronizedUpdateGameState` method should ensure that the game state is updated one action at a time. The `synchronizedBroadcastGameState` method should ensure that all players receive the updated game state at the same time.

**Task 2: Inter-thread Communication with Lock Objects**

In the context of a multiplayer game server, inter-thread communication is key to managing player actions and real-time events. Select the topic "Lock Objects" from the list. Implement two methods:

1. `lockObjectUpdateGameState(GameState gameState, PlayerAction playerAction, Lock lock)`: This method should take in the current game state, a player action, and a lock object, and update the game state in a thread-safe manner using the lock object.
    
2. `lockObjectBroadcastGameState(GameState gameState, List<Player> players, Lock lock)`: This method should take in the current game state, a list of players, and a lock object, and broadcast the game state to all players in a thread-safe manner using the lock object.
    

Example: If two players perform actions at the same time, the `lockObjectUpdateGameState` method should ensure that the game state is updated one action at a time. The `lockObjectBroadcastGameState` method should ensure that all players receive the updated game state at the same time.

**Task 3: Thread Pools and Atomic Variables in Multiplayer Game Server**

In a multiplayer game server, managing player actions and real-time events efficiently is important. Select the topic "Thread Pools" and "Atomic Variables" from the list. Implement two methods:

1. `threadPoolUpdateGameState(ExecutorService executorService, GameState gameState, PlayerAction playerAction, AtomicInteger atomicInteger)`: This method should take in an ExecutorService (representing a thread pool), the current game state, a player action, and an AtomicInteger. It should update the game state in a thread-safe manner using the thread pool and atomic integer.
    
2. `threadPoolBroadcastGameState(ExecutorService executorService, GameState gameState, List<Player> players, AtomicInteger atomicInteger)`: This method should take in an ExecutorService (representing a thread pool), the current game state, a list of players, and an AtomicInteger. It should broadcast the game state to all players in a thread-safe manner using the thread pool and atomic integer.
    

Example: If two players perform actions at the same time, the `threadPoolUpdateGameState` method should ensure that the game state is updated one action at a time. The `threadPoolBroadcastGameState` method should ensure that all players receive the updated game state at the same time.

**Task 4: Daemon Threads, Thread Safety and Performance Tuning for Threads**

In the context of a multiplayer game server, managing player actions and real-time events efficiently is important. Select the topics "Daemon Threads", "Thread Safety" and "Performance Tuning for Threads" from the list. Implement three methods:

1. `daemonThreadUpdateGameState(GameState gameState, PlayerAction playerAction)`: This method should take in the current game state and a player action, and update the game state in a thread-safe manner using a daemon thread.
    
2. `threadSafetyBroadcastGameState(GameState gameState, List<Player> players)`: This method should take in the current game state and a list of players, and broadcast the game state to all players in a thread-safe manner.
    
3. `performanceTuningUpdateGameState(GameState gameState, PlayerAction playerAction)`: This method should take in the current game state and a player action, and update the game state in a thread-safe manner with performance tuning considerations.
    

Example: If two players perform actions at the same time, the `daemonThreadUpdateGameState` and `performanceTuningUpdateGameState` methods should ensure that the game state is updated one action at a time. The `threadSafetyBroadcastGameState` method should ensure that all players receive the updated game state at the same time.
