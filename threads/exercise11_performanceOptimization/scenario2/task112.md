**Task 1**

**Title:** Thread Management and Synchronization in Energy Distribution

**Problem:** You are given a system with `n` smart meters that send energy consumption data. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `public void distributeEnergy(int meterId, int energyUnits)`: This method will be called by each smart meter to send the energy consumption data. The method should ensure that the energy distribution is done in a synchronized manner to avoid any data inconsistency.
    
2. `public int getTotalEnergyConsumption()`: This method should return the total energy consumption from all the smart meters.
    

Assume that the `distributeEnergy` method can be called concurrently by multiple threads.

**Example:**

Input:

Thread 1: distributeEnergy(1, 100);

Thread 2: distributeEnergy(2, 200);

Thread 3: distributeEnergy(3, 300);

Thread 4: getTotalEnergyConsumption();

Output: `600`

**Task 2**

**Topic:** Inter-thread Communication

**Title:** Inter-thread Communication in Energy Management

**Problem:** You are given a system with `n` smart meters and a central energy management system. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `public void sendEnergyData(int meterId, int energyUnits)`: This method will be called by each smart meter to send the energy consumption data. The method should ensure that the energy data is sent to the central system in a synchronized manner.
    
2. `public void processEnergyData()`: This method should process the energy data from all the smart meters. The method should wait if there is no data to process and proceed as soon as data arrives from any smart meter.
    

Assume that the `sendEnergyData` method can be called concurrently by multiple threads.

**Example:**

Input:

Thread 1: sendEnergyData(1, 100);

Thread 2: sendEnergyData(2, 200);

Thread 3: processEnergyData();

Output: `Data processed: 300`

**Task 3**

**Topic:** Thread Pools

**Title:** Efficient Energy Data Processing with Thread Pools

**Problem:** You are given a system with `n` smart meters and a central energy management system. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `public void sendEnergyData(int meterId, int energyUnits)`: This method will be called by each smart meter to send the energy consumption data. The method should ensure that the energy data is sent to the central system in a synchronized manner.
    
2. `public void processEnergyDataWithThreadPool()`: This method should process the energy data from all the smart meters using a thread pool to efficiently manage the processing threads.
    

Assume that the `sendEnergyData` method can be called concurrently by multiple threads.

**Example:**

Input:

Thread 1: sendEnergyData(1, 100);

Thread 2: sendEnergyData(2, 200);

Thread 3: processEnergyDataWithThreadPool();

Output: `Data processed: 300`

**Task 4**

**Topic:** Atomic Variables

**Title:** Atomic Operations in Energy Management

**Problem:** You are given a system with `n` smart meters and a central energy management system. Your task is to implement three methods:

1. `public void sendEnergyData(int meterId, int energyUnits)`: This method will be called by each smart meter to send the energy consumption data. The method should ensure that the energy data is sent to the central system in an atomic manner.
    
2. `public void processEnergyData()`: This method should process the energy data from all the smart meters. The method should wait if there is no data to process and proceed as soon as data arrives from any smart meter.
    
3. `public int getTotalEnergyProcessed()`: This method should return the total energy processed by the central system.
    

Assume that the `sendEnergyData` and `processEnergyData` methods can be called concurrently by multiple threads.

**Example:**

Input:

Thread 1: sendEnergyData(1, 100);

Thread 2: sendEnergyData(2, 200);

Thread 3: processEnergyData();

Thread 4: getTotalEnergyProcessed();

Output: `300`
