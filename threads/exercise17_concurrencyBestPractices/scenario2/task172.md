**Task 1: Thread Management and Synchronization**

Problem: You are given a transaction record system that processes transactions in a financial institution. The system uses multiple threads to process the transactions. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `processTransactions(List<Transaction> transactions)`: This method should use multiple threads to process the transactions concurrently. Each thread should process one transaction at a time. Ensure that the threads are synchronized to avoid any data inconsistency.
    
2. `getProcessedTransactions()`: This method should return a list of all processed transactions. Ensure that this method is thread-safe.
    

Example: If the `processTransactions` method is called with a list of 5 transactions, it should process all transactions concurrently. The `getProcessedTransactions` method should return a list of all 5 processed transactions.

**Task 2: Inter-thread Communication**

Problem: In the context of the financial institution, implement a system that uses inter-thread communication to analyze communication logs. The system should have two methods:

1. `addLog(Log log)`: This method should add a log to a queue. If the queue is full, the thread should wait until there is space in the queue.
    
2. `analyzeLogs()`: This method should analyze logs from the queue. If the queue is empty, the thread should wait until there is a log in the queue.
    

Example: If the `addLog` method is called and the queue is full, the thread should wait. If the `analyzeLogs` method is called and the queue is empty, the thread should wait.

**Task 3: Thread Pools and Atomic Variables**

Problem: Implement a system that uses a thread pool and atomic variables to analyze transaction records. The system should have two methods:

1. `submitTransaction(Transaction transaction)`: This method should submit a transaction to a thread pool for processing. The thread pool should have a fixed number of threads.
    
2. `getProcessedTransactionCount()`: This method should return the number of transactions that have been processed. Use an atomic variable to keep track of this count.
    

Example: If the `submitTransaction` method is called 5 times, it should submit 5 transactions to the thread pool. The `getProcessedTransactionCount` method should return 5 after all transactions have been processed.

**Task 4: Executors Framework and Lock Objects**

Problem: Implement a system that uses the Executors framework and lock objects to analyze communication logs. The system should have three methods:

1. `submitLog(Log log)`: This method should submit a log to an executor for analysis.
    
2. `shutdown()`: This method should shutdown the executor after all logs have been analyzed.
    
3. `getAnalyzedLogCount()`: This method should return the number of logs that have been analyzed. Use a lock object to ensure that the count is updated correctly.
    

Example: If the `submitLog` method is called 3 times, it should submit 3 logs to the executor. The `shutdown` method should shutdown the executor after all logs have been analyzed. The `getAnalyzedLogCount` method should return 3 after all logs have been analyzed.
