**Task 1: Thread Management and Synchronization**

Problem: You are given a cybersecurity system that receives threat data from multiple sources. The system uses multiple threads to analyze the data. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `void processThreatData(List<ThreatData> data)`: This method should create and start multiple threads, each analyzing a portion of the threat data. Use synchronization to ensure that only one thread can access a piece of data at a time.
    
2. `ThreatSummary getThreatSummary()`: This method should return a summary of the analyzed threat data. It should wait for all threads to finish their analysis before gathering the results.
    

Example: If the `processThreatData` method is given a list of 10 `ThreatData` objects, it should create 10 threads, each analyzing one `ThreatData` object. The `getThreatSummary` method should return a `ThreatSummary` object that includes the results of all analyses.

**Task 2: Inter-thread Communication**

Problem: Referring to the same cybersecurity system, focus on inter-thread communication. Implement two methods:

1. `void distributeThreatData(List<ThreatData> data)`: This method should distribute the threat data among multiple threads for analysis. Use inter-thread communication to ensure that a thread does not start analyzing data until it has received it.
    
2. `void updateDefenseMechanisms()`: This method should update the system's defense mechanisms based on the analyzed threat data. It should not start updating until all threads have finished their analysis.
    

Example: If the `distributeThreatData` method is given a list of 10 `ThreatData` objects, it should distribute them among 10 threads. The `updateDefenseMechanisms` method should wait for all threads to finish their analysis before starting the update.

**Task 3: Thread Pools and Atomic Variables**

Problem: With the same cybersecurity system in mind, focus on thread pools and atomic variables. Implement two methods:

1. `void analyzeThreatData(List<ThreatData> data)`: This method should use a thread pool to analyze the threat data. It should also use atomic variables to keep track of the number of threats analyzed.
    
2. `int getNumberOfThreatsAnalyzed()`: This method should return the number of threats analyzed. It should use the atomic variable from the `analyzeThreatData` method.
    

Example: If the `analyzeThreatData` method is given a list of 10 `ThreatData` objects, it should use a thread pool to analyze them. The `getNumberOfThreatsAnalyzed` method should return 10 after all analyses are complete.

**Task 4: Executors Framework and Lock Objects**

Problem: Considering the same cybersecurity system, focus on the Executors framework and lock objects. Implement three methods:

1. `void analyzeThreatData(List<ThreatData> data)`: This method should use the Executors framework to create a fixed thread pool and analyze the threat data.
    
2. `void lockThreatData(ThreatData data)`: This method should use a lock object to ensure that only one thread can access a `ThreatData` object at a time.
    
3. `void unlockThreatData(ThreatData data)`: This method should release the lock on a `ThreatData` object, allowing other threads to access it.
    

Example: If the `analyzeThreatData` method is given a list of 10 `ThreatData` objects, it should use the Executors framework to analyze them. The `lockThreatData` and `unlockThreatData` methods should ensure that only one thread can access a `ThreatData` object at a time.
