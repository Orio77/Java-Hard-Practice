**Task 1: Thread Management in Content Recommendation Engine**

You are tasked with creating a content recommendation engine for a streaming service. The engine should be able to process user viewing habits, preferences, and interactions concurrently to deliver real-time, tailored content suggestions.

**Function 1: `processUserPreferences(Thread userThread)`**

This function should take a user thread as an input and process the user's preferences concurrently. The function should use synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.

**Function 2: `deliverRecommendations(Thread userThread)`**

This function should take a user thread as an input and deliver real-time content suggestions based on the processed user preferences. The function should use thread operations to ensure that the recommendations are delivered in real-time.

**Example:**

Input: User thread with viewing habits, preferences, and interactions Output: Real-time, tailored content suggestions

**Task 2: Thread Pools in Content Recommendation Engine**

Topic: Thread Pools

You are tasked with creating a content recommendation engine for a streaming service. The engine should be able to process user viewing habits, preferences, and interactions concurrently to deliver real-time, tailored content suggestions.

**Function 1: `createThreadPool(int numberOfThreads)`**

This function should create a thread pool with a specified number of threads. The function should use thread operations to manage the thread pool.

**Function 2: `assignTasksToThreadPool(ThreadPoolExecutor threadPool, List<Task> tasks)`**

This function should assign tasks to the thread pool. The function should use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that tasks are assigned and executed in an orderly manner.

**Example:**

Input: List of tasks to be assigned to the thread pool Output: Real-time, tailored content suggestions

**Task 3: Concurrency Utilities in Content Recommendation Engine**

Topic: Concurrency Utilities

You are tasked with creating a content recommendation engine for a streaming service. The engine should be able to process user viewing habits, preferences, and interactions concurrently to deliver real-time, tailored content suggestions.

**Function 1: `useSemaphore(Semaphore semaphore)`**

This function should use a semaphore to control access to an important part of the code that cannot be executed concurrently.

**Function 2: `useCountDownLatch(CountDownLatch latch)`**

This function should use a CountDownLatch to ensure that all threads have completed their tasks before proceeding.

**Example:**

Input: Semaphore and CountDownLatch objects Output: Real-time, tailored content suggestions

**Task 4: Executors Framework in Content Recommendation Engine**

Topic: Executors Framework

You are tasked with creating a content recommendation engine for a streaming service. The engine should be able to process user viewing habits, preferences, and interactions concurrently to deliver real-time, tailored content suggestions.

**Function 1: `createFixedThreadPool(int numberOfThreads)`**

This function should create a fixed thread pool using the Executors framework.

**Function 2: `scheduleTasksWithFixedDelay(ScheduledExecutorService executorService, List<Task> tasks, long delay)`**

This function should schedule tasks with a fixed delay using the Executors framework.

**Function 3: `shutdownExecutorService(ExecutorService executorService)`**

This function should shutdown the executor service gracefully.

**Example:**

Input: List of tasks to be scheduled with a fixed delay Output: Real-time, tailored content suggestions
