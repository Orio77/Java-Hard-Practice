**Task 1**

**Title:** Implementing Thread Synchronization in Traffic Light Control System

**Problem:** You are given a traffic light control system that operates on multiple threads. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `synchronizeTrafficLights()`: This method should ensure that when one traffic light is green, all other traffic lights are red to prevent accidents. Use synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
    
2. `adjustTrafficLightPattern(TrafficLight trafficLight, TrafficPattern pattern)`: This method should adjust the traffic light pattern of a specific traffic light based on the provided pattern. The pattern adjustment should be thread-safe.
    

**Input:** The input to both methods will be the traffic light system which is a shared resource among multiple threads.

**Output:** The output of these methods should be the updated state of the traffic light system.

**Example:** If there are three traffic lights (A, B, C) and traffic light A is green, then traffic lights B and C should be red. If the traffic pattern for traffic light A changes, the system should adjust the pattern without affecting the state of other traffic lights.

**Task 2**

**Topic:** Inter-thread Communication

**Title:** Implementing Inter-thread Communication in Traffic Light Control System

**Problem:** You are given a traffic light control system that operates on multiple threads. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `sendSignal(TrafficLight sender, TrafficLight receiver, Signal signal)`: This method should allow one traffic light to send a signal to another traffic light. The sending and receiving of signals should be thread-safe.
    
2. `receiveSignal(TrafficLight receiver)`: This method should allow a traffic light to receive a signal from another traffic light. The receiving of signals should be thread-safe.
    

**Input:** The input to both methods will be the traffic light system which is a shared resource among multiple threads.

**Output:** The output of these methods should be the updated state of the traffic light system.

**Example:** If traffic light A sends a signal to traffic light B, traffic light B should be able to receive the signal without any interference from other threads.

**Task 3**

**Topic:** Atomic Variables

**Title:** Implementing Atomic Variables in Traffic Light Control System

**Problem:** You are given a traffic light control system that operates on multiple threads. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `incrementTrafficCount(TrafficLight trafficLight)`: This method should increment the traffic count of a specific traffic light. The increment operation should be atomic.
    
2. `getTrafficCount(TrafficLight trafficLight)`: This method should return the current traffic count of a specific traffic light. The read operation should be atomic.
    

**Input:** The input to both methods will be the traffic light system which is a shared resource among multiple threads.

**Output:** The output of these methods should be the updated state of the traffic light system.

**Example:** If multiple threads are incrementing the traffic count of traffic light A, the final traffic count should be consistent and correct.

**Task 4**

**Topic:** Executors Framework

**Title:** Implementing Executors Framework in Traffic Light Control System

**Problem:** You are given a traffic light control system that operates on multiple threads. Your task is to implement three methods:

1. `startTrafficLightSystem()`: This method should start the traffic light system using an ExecutorService. The system should be able to handle multiple traffic lights concurrently.
    
2. `stopTrafficLightSystem()`: This method should stop the traffic light system gracefully. All running traffic lights should finish their current task before the system shuts down.
    
3. `restartTrafficLightSystem()`: This method should restart the traffic light system. The system should shut down gracefully before starting again.
    

**Input:** The input to all methods will be the traffic light system which is a shared resource among multiple threads.

**Output:** The output of these methods should be the updated state of the traffic light system.

**Example:** If the traffic light system is started, all traffic lights should operate concurrently. If the system is stopped, all traffic lights should finish their current task before shutting down. If the system is restarted, it should shut down gracefully before starting again.
