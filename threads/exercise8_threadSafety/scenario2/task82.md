**Task 1**

**Title:** Implementing Thread Synchronization in a Gaming Server

**Problem:** You are given a gaming server that can handle multiple players. The server has a method `processRequest(Player player)` that processes a player's request. However, the server can only process one request at a time. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `synchronizedProcessRequest(Player player)`: This method should process a player's request in a thread-safe manner using synchronization.
    
2. `optimizedSynchronizedProcessRequest(Player player)`: This method should also process a player's request in a thread-safe manner, but it should use a more optimized synchronization mechanism to allow multiple requests to be processed concurrently if they are from different players.
    

**Example:**

Input: `player1`, `player2`, `player3` (where `player1`, `player2`, and `player3` are different player objects)

Output: The output should show that the requests from different players are processed concurrently, but the requests from the same player are processed one at a time.

**Task 2**

**Title:** Implementing Thread Pools in a Gaming Server

**Problem:** You are given a gaming server that can handle multiple players. The server has a method `processRequest(Player player)` that processes a player's request. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `threadPoolProcessRequest(Player player)`: This method should process a player's request using a fixed thread pool.
    
2. `optimizedThreadPoolProcessRequest(Player player)`: This method should process a player's request using a cached thread pool.
    

**Example:**

Input: `player1`, `player2`, `player3` (where `player1`, `player2`, and `player3` are different player objects)

Output: The output should show that the requests from different players are processed concurrently, and the server should not create more threads than necessary.

**Task 3**

**Title:** Implementing Atomic Variables in a Gaming Server

**Problem:** You are given a gaming server that can handle multiple players. The server has a method `processRequest(Player player)` that processes a player's request and updates a global score. Your task is to implement two methods:

1. `atomicProcessRequest(Player player)`: This method should process a player's request and update the global score in a thread-safe manner using atomic variables.
    
2. `optimizedAtomicProcessRequest(Player player)`: This method should also process a player's request and update the global score in a thread-safe manner, but it should use a more optimized atomic operation.
    

**Example:**

Input: `player1`, `player2`, `player3` (where `player1`, `player2`, and `player3` are different player objects)

Output: The output should show that the global score is updated correctly even when multiple requests are processed concurrently.

**Task 4**

**Title:** Implementing Fork/Join Framework in a Gaming Server

**Problem:** You are given a gaming server that can handle multiple players. The server has a method `processRequest(Player player)` that processes a player's request. Your task is to implement three methods:

1. `forkJoinProcessRequest(Player player)`: This method should process a player's request using the Fork/Join framework.
    
2. `optimizedForkJoinProcessRequest(Player player)`: This method should process a player's request using an optimized version of the Fork/Join framework.
    
3. `comparePerformance()`: This method should compare the performance of the `forkJoinProcessRequest(Player player)` method and the `optimizedForkJoinProcessRequest(Player player)` method.
    

**Example:**

Input: `player1`, `player2`, `player3` (where `player1`, `player2`, and `player3` are different player objects)

Output: The output should show that the requests from different players are processed concurrently, and the `comparePerformance()` method should show which method is more efficient.
