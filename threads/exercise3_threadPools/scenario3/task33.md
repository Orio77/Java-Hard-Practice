**Task 1**

**Title:** Thread Management for Backup Operations

**Problem:** You are tasked with creating a system that performs concurrent backups of critical data across multiple servers. Implement two methods:

1. `initiateBackup(List<Server> servers)`: This method should initiate the backup process for each server in the list concurrently using threads. Each server backup should be a separate task. The method should return once all backups have completed.
    
2. `monitorBackupProgress(List<Server> servers)`: This method should monitor the progress of the backup operations and print the status of each server's backup operation every second until all backups are complete.
    

Assume you have a `Server` class with the following methods:

- `startBackup()`: Starts the backup process. This process takes a random time between 1 to 10 seconds to complete.
- `isBackupComplete()`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the backup process for this server is complete.
- `getBackupProgress()`: Returns a float between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the progress of the backup operation.

**Input:** A list of 5 servers.

**Output:** The `initiateBackup` method should return once all server backups are complete. The `monitorBackupProgress` method should print the backup progress of each server every second.

**Task 2**

**Topic:** Synchronization

**Title:** Synchronized Backup Operations

**Problem:** Building on the previous task, now you need to ensure that no two backups occur at the same time. This is to prevent network congestion. Implement two methods:

1. `synchronizedBackup(List<Server> servers)`: This method should initiate the backup process for each server in the list one at a time using synchronization mechanisms. The method should return once all backups have completed.
    
2. `monitorSynchronizedBackup(List<Server> servers)`: This method should monitor the progress of the backup operations and print the status of each server's backup operation every second until all backups are complete.
    

**Input:** A list of 5 servers.

**Output:** The `synchronizedBackup` method should return once all server backups are complete. The `monitorSynchronizedBackup` method should print the backup progress of each server every second.

**Task 3**

**Topic:** Thread Pools

**Title:** Efficient Backup Operations with Thread Pools

**Problem:** To make the backup operations more efficient, you decide to use a thread pool. Implement two methods:

1. `efficientBackup(List<Server> servers, int numThreads)`: This method should initiate the backup process for each server in the list using a thread pool with `numThreads` threads. The method should return once all backups have completed.
    
2. `monitorEfficientBackup(List<Server> servers)`: This method should monitor the progress of the backup operations and print the status of each server's backup operation every second until all backups are complete.
    

**Input:** A list of 5 servers and `numThreads` = 3.

**Output:** The `efficientBackup` method should return once all server backups are complete. The `monitorEfficientBackup` method should print the backup progress of each server every second.

**Task 4**

**Topic:** Atomic Variables

**Title:** Atomic Backup Operations

**Problem:** To ensure data consistency during backup operations, you decide to use atomic variables. Implement three methods:

1. `atomicBackup(List<Server> servers)`: This method should initiate the backup process for each server in the list using threads. It should use atomic variables to ensure that the backup operation is thread-safe. The method should return once all backups have completed.
    
2. `monitorAtomicBackup(List<Server> servers)`: This method should monitor the progress of the backup operations and print the status of each server's backup operation every second until all backups are complete.
    
3. `getTotalBackupProgress(List<Server> servers)`: This method should return the total progress of all backup operations. It should use atomic variables to ensure that the operation is thread-safe.
    

**Input:** A list of 5 servers.

**Output:** The `atomicBackup` method should return once all server backups are complete. The `monitorAtomicBackup` method should print the backup progress of each server every second. The `getTotalBackupProgress` method should return the total progress of all backup operations.
