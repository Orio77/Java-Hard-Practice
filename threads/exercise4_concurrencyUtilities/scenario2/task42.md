**Task 1**

**Problem:** Implement a system that simulates the real-time analysis of energy consumption data from smart meters. You are required to implement two methods:

1. `public void addMeterData(MeterData data)`: This method will receive data from a smart meter and add it to a shared data structure. Ensure that this method is thread-safe.
    
2. `public List<MeterData> analyzeData()`: This method will analyze the data in the shared data structure and return a list of `MeterData` that exceed a certain threshold of energy consumption. This method should also be thread-safe.
    

**Input:** The `MeterData` class has two fields: `meterId` (String) and `consumption` (double). The `addMeterData` method will be called concurrently by multiple threads. The `analyzeData` method will be called periodically to analyze the data.

**Output:** The `analyzeData` method should return a list of `MeterData` that exceed a certain threshold of energy consumption.

**Task 2**

**Topic:** Thread Pools

**Problem:** Implement a system that uses a thread pool to process the data from smart meters. You are required to implement two methods:

1. `public void processMeterData(MeterData data)`: This method will receive data from a smart meter and add it to a queue for processing. A thread from the thread pool should then process the data.
    
2. `public void shutdown()`: This method will shutdown the thread pool when it is no longer needed.
    

**Input:** The `MeterData` class has two fields: `meterId` (String) and `consumption` (double). The `processMeterData` method will be called concurrently by multiple threads.

**Output:** The `processMeterData` method does not return anything. The `shutdown` method should ensure that all tasks in the queue are processed before the thread pool is shutdown.

**Task 3**

**Topic:** Atomic Variables

**Problem:** Implement a system that uses atomic variables to keep track of the total energy consumption from all smart meters. You are required to implement two methods:

1. `public void addMeterData(MeterData data)`: This method will receive data from a smart meter and add the energy consumption to a shared atomic variable.
    
2. `public double getTotalConsumption()`: This method will return the total energy consumption from all smart meters.
    

**Input:** The `MeterData` class has two fields: `meterId` (String) and `consumption` (double). The `addMeterData` method will be called concurrently by multiple threads.

**Output:** The `getTotalConsumption` method should return the total energy consumption from all smart meters.

**Task 4**

**Topic:** Executors Framework

**Problem:** Implement a system that uses the Executors framework to process the data from smart meters. You are required to implement three methods:

1. `public void processMeterData(MeterData data)`: This method will receive data from a smart meter and submit a task to an executor service for processing.
    
2. `public void shutdown()`: This method will shutdown the executor service when it is no longer needed.
    
3. `public Future<MeterData> getProcessedData(String meterId)`: This method will return a `Future` that represents the processed data for a specific meter.
    

**Input:** The `MeterData` class has two fields: `meterId` (String) and `consumption` (double). The `processMeterData` and `getProcessedData` methods will be called concurrently by multiple threads.

**Output:** The `getProcessedData` method should return a `Future` that represents the processed data for a specific meter. The `shutdown` method should ensure that all tasks in the queue are processed before the executor service is shutdown.
