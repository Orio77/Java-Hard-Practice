**Task 1: Traffic Sensor Data Processing**

Implement a `TrafficSensorDataProcessor` class that processes traffic sensor data concurrently. The class should have the following methods:

1. `void addData(TrafficData data)`: This method should add traffic data to a queue for processing. Use a thread-safe queue to ensure that data can be added and processed concurrently without data corruption.
    
2. `TrafficData processData()`: This method should process data from the queue. If the queue is empty, the method should wait until data is available. Use synchronization to ensure that data is not processed while new data is being added.
    

Example:

Input: `addData(new TrafficData("Sensor1", 100))`, `addData(new TrafficData("Sensor2", 200))`, `processData()`, `processData()`

Output: `TrafficData("Sensor1", 100)`, `TrafficData("Sensor2", 200)`

**Task 2: Pollution Sensor Data Processing with Thread Pools**

Selecting "Thread Pools" from the list, implement a `PollutionSensorDataProcessor` class that processes pollution sensor data concurrently using a thread pool. The class should have the following methods:

1. `void addData(PollutionData data)`: This method should add pollution data to a queue for processing. Use a thread-safe queue to ensure that data can be added and processed concurrently without data corruption.
    
2. `PollutionData processData()`: This method should process data from the queue using a thread pool. If the queue is empty, the method should wait until data is available. Use synchronization to ensure that data is not processed while new data is being added.
    

Example:

Input: `addData(new PollutionData("Sensor1", 0.03))`, `addData(new PollutionData("Sensor2", 0.04))`, `processData()`, `processData()`

Output: `PollutionData("Sensor1", 0.03)`, `PollutionData("Sensor2", 0.04)`

**Task 3: Weather Sensor Data Processing with Atomic Variables**

Selecting "Atomic Variables" from the list, implement a `WeatherSensorDataProcessor` class that processes weather sensor data concurrently using atomic variables. The class should have the following methods:

1. `void addData(WeatherData data)`: This method should add weather data to a queue for processing. Use a thread-safe queue to ensure that data can be added and processed concurrently without data corruption.
    
2. `WeatherData processData()`: This method should process data from the queue. If the queue is empty, the method should wait until data is available. Use an atomic variable to keep track of the number of data items processed.
    

Example:

Input: `addData(new WeatherData("Sensor1", 25.5))`, `addData(new WeatherData("Sensor2", 26.5))`, `processData()`, `processData()`

Output: `WeatherData("Sensor1", 25.5)`, `WeatherData("Sensor2", 26.5)`

**Task 4: Sensor Data Processing with Executors Framework**

Selecting "Executors Framework" from the list, implement a `SensorDataProcessor` class that processes sensor data concurrently using the Executors framework. The class should have the following methods:

1. `void addData(SensorData data)`: This method should add sensor data to a queue for processing. Use a thread-safe queue to ensure that data can be added and processed concurrently without data corruption.
    
2. `SensorData processData()`: This method should process data from the queue using the Executors framework. If the queue is empty, the method should wait until data is available.
    
3. `void shutdown()`: This method should shutdown the executor service gracefully.
    

Example:

Input: `addData(new SensorData("Sensor1", "Traffic", 100))`, `addData(new SensorData("Sensor2", "Pollution", 0.03))`, `processData()`, `processData()`, `shutdown()`

Output: `SensorData("Sensor1", "Traffic", 100)`, `SensorData("Sensor2", "Pollution", 0.03)`
