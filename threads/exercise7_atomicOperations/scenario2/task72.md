**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Atomic Operations**  
Design a class `NetworkPacketProcessor` that simulates the processing of network packets. Implement two methods:

1. `void receivePacket(NetworkPacket packet)`: This method receives a network packet and adds it to a processing queue. Ensure that this operation is thread-safe and atomic.
    
2. `NetworkPacket processPacket()`: This method processes a packet from the queue. If the queue is empty, it should return null. This operation should also be thread-safe and atomic.
    

Example: If two threads call `receivePacket` simultaneously, the packets should be added to the queue in the order they were received. If `processPacket` is called while the queue is empty, it should return null.

**Task 2: Concurrency Utilities and Atomic Variables**  
Given the topic of Concurrency Utilities, design a class `ConcurrentNetworkMonitor` that monitors network traffic concurrently. Implement two methods:

1. `void monitorTraffic(NetworkTraffic traffic)`: This method monitors network traffic and updates a shared, atomic counter with the total number of packets.
    
2. `long getPacketCount()`: This method returns the current packet count.
    

Example: If multiple threads call `monitorTraffic` simultaneously, the packet count should be updated correctly. `getPacketCount` should always return the correct count.

**Task 3: Executors Framework and Atomic Operations**  
With the Executors Framework in mind, design a class `NetworkExecutor` that uses an ExecutorService to process network packets. Implement two methods:

1. `void submitPacket(NetworkPacket packet)`: This method submits a packet for processing. The processing should be done in a separate thread.
    
2. `boolean isProcessingComplete()`: This method checks if all submitted packets have been processed. This operation should be atomic.
    

Example: If multiple threads submit packets for processing, the executor should handle them correctly. `isProcessingComplete` should return true only if all packets have been processed.

**Task 4: Fork/Join Framework, Atomic Operations, and Thread Safety**  
Considering the Fork/Join Framework, design a class `NetworkAnalyzer` that analyzes network traffic using a fork/join pool. Implement three methods:

1. `void analyzeTraffic(NetworkTraffic traffic)`: This method analyzes network traffic. The analysis should be done in parallel using a fork/join pool.
    
2. `boolean isAnalysisComplete()`: This method checks if the analysis of all traffic has been completed. This operation should be atomic and thread-safe.
    
3. `AnalysisResult getAnalysisResult()`: This method returns the result of the analysis. If the analysis is not complete, it should return null.
    

Example: If multiple threads call `analyzeTraffic`, the analysis should be done in parallel. `isAnalysisComplete` should return true only if all traffic has been analyzed. `getAnalysisResult` should return the correct result or null if the analysis is not complete.
