**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Inter-thread Communication**

You are tasked with creating a game server that can handle multiple players simultaneously. The server should be able to process player requests in a synchronized manner to avoid any conflicts.

**Function 1: `synchronizedProcessing()`**

This function should implement the concept of synchronized threads. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and process them in a synchronized manner. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Function 2: `interThreadCommunication()`**

This function should implement the concept of inter-thread communication. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and a 'signal' that indicates when a particular request has been processed. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Example:**

Input:

List<String> requests = Arrays.asList("Player1", "Player2", "Player3");

String signal = "DONE";

Output:

synchronizedProcessing(requests); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]

interThreadCommunication(requests, signal); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]

**Task 2: Thread Pools and Deadlock Avoidance**

**Function 1: `implementThreadPool()`**

This function should implement the concept of a thread pool. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and a maximum number of threads that can be active at any given time. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Function 2: `avoidDeadlock()`**

This function should implement the concept of deadlock avoidance. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and process them in such a way that deadlock is avoided. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Example:**

Input:

List<String> requests = Arrays.asList("Player1", "Player2", "Player3");

int maxThreads = 2;

Output:

implementThreadPool(requests, maxThreads); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]

avoidDeadlock(requests); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]

**Task 3: Thread Safety and Lock Objects**

**Function 1: `ensureThreadSafety()`**

This function should implement the concept of thread safety. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and process them in a thread-safe manner. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Function 2: `useLockObjects()`**

This function should implement the concept of lock objects. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and a lock object. The function should use the lock object to ensure that only one thread can access a resource at a time. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Example:**

Input:

List<String> requests = Arrays.asList("Player1", "Player2", "Player3");

Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

Output:

ensureThreadSafety(requests); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]

useLockObjects(requests, lock); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]

**Task 4: Executors Framework and Fork/Join Framework**

**Function 1: `useExecutorsFramework()`**

This function should implement the Executors framework. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and process them using the Executors framework. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Function 2: `useForkJoinFramework()`**

This function should implement the Fork/Join framework. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and process them using the Fork/Join framework. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Function 3: `handleInterruptedException()`**

This function should handle the InterruptedException. It should take in a list of player requests (represented as strings) and process them in such a way that if an InterruptedException occurs, it is properly handled. The function should return the processed requests in the order they were processed.

**Example:**

Input:

List<String> requests = Arrays.asList("Player1", "Player2", "Player3");

Output:

useExecutorsFramework(requests); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]

useForkJoinFramework(requests); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]

handleInterruptedException(requests); // ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3"]
