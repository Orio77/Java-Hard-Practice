**Task 1: Thread Synchronization and Inter-thread Communication**

**Problem:** Implement a Network Packet Processor in Java that processes network packets in parallel using threads. The processor should have two main functionalities:

1. `processPacket(Packet packet)`: This method should process a given network packet. The processing of packets should be synchronized to avoid race conditions. Use `synchronized` keyword for this purpose.
    
2. `getProcessedPackets()`: This method should return a list of all processed packets. Use `wait()` and `notify()` methods to handle inter-thread communication.
    

**Input:** A list of network packets.

**Output:** A list of processed network packets.

**Task 2: Thread Pools and Executors Framework**

**Problem:** Implement a Network Traffic Analyzer in Java that analyzes network traffic in parallel using a thread pool. The analyzer should have two main functionalities:

1. `analyzeTraffic(NetworkTraffic traffic)`: This method should analyze a given network traffic. Use a thread pool to handle multiple network traffic instances concurrently. Use `Executors` framework for this purpose.
    
2. `getAnalyzedTraffic()`: This method should return a list of all analyzed network traffic.
    

**Input:** A list of network traffic instances.

**Output:** A list of analyzed network traffic instances.

**Task 3: Atomic Variables and Lock Objects**

**Problem:** Implement a Network Intrusion Detector in Java that detects network intrusions in parallel using threads. The detector should have two main functionalities:

1. `detectIntrusion(NetworkData data)`: This method should detect intrusion in a given network data. Use `AtomicInteger` to count the number of intrusions detected concurrently by multiple threads.
    
2. `getIntrusionCount()`: This method should return the total number of intrusions detected. Use `ReentrantLock` to ensure that the count is updated safely when accessed by multiple threads.
    

**Input:** A list of network data instances.

**Output:** The total number of intrusions detected.

**Task 4: Fork/Join Framework and Parallel Algorithms Implementation**

**Problem:** Implement a Network Data Sorter in Java that sorts network data in parallel using the Fork/Join framework. The sorter should have three main functionalities:

1. `sortData(NetworkData data)`: This method should sort a given network data. Use the Fork/Join framework to sort the data in parallel.
    
2. `mergeData(NetworkData data1, NetworkData data2)`: This method should merge two sorted network data instances into a single sorted instance.
    
3. `getSortedData()`: This method should return a list of all sorted network data instances.
    

**Input:** A list of network data instances.

**Output:** A list of sorted network data instances.
